              " '\\nBea, a law student with doubts about her path, connects instantly with the charming, yet arrogant, Ben on a whirlwind first date. Their passion cools overnight, however, leaving Bea heartbroken and fuming after overhearing Ben’s dismissive remarks to a friend. Years later, fate throws them together at a luxurious Australian wedding, forcing them to share space and endure awkward family gatherings – not helped by the presence of Bea’s persistent ex-fiancé and Ben’s jealous ex-girlfriend.\\nIn an attempt to ease the tension and ensure a smooth celebration, the wedding party hatches a mischievous plan: convince everyone Bea and Ben are a happy couple. Despite initial resistance, fuelled by personal motives, both agree to the charade. Bea seeks escape from her ex’s shadow, while Ben hopes to spark jealousy in his old flame.\\nAs they navigate the masquerade, participating in romantic couple activities and faking intimate moments, something unexpected happens. The line between pretense and reality blurs. Underneath the bickering and witty banter, they discover unexpected vulnerabilities and shared passions, leading to a genuine connection they can’t ignore.\\nTheir budding romance faces obstacles: Jonathan’s disapproval, Bea’s overbearing parents, and the inevitable exposure of their charade. But through humorous confrontations and self-reflection, they learn to trust each other and fight for their newfound love. In the end, defying expectations and overcoming external pressures, Ben and Bea choose to embrace their feelings, leaving the future open to exciting possibilities.\\nTheir journey is not just about finding love, but also about self-discovery. Bea sheds her insecurities and carves her own path, while Ben confronts his emotional walls and learns to be vulnerable. Their relationship, born from a playful ruse, blossoms into something authentic and true, reminding us that love can sometimes surprise us in the most unexpected places.\\n\\n* * *\\n[Bea] Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.\\n[Bea] Hi. Where’s your bathroom?\\nIt’s for customers only.\\n[Bea] Oh, okay. I’ll buy something.\\nYou gotta pay up there.\\n[Bea] Can I just go now? I really have to pee.\\nI’ve got a large cappuccino for Skylar.\\nThanks.\\n[Bea] I also kind of, well, no… I know that establishments that serve food or drink must be open to the public regardless of their purchasing class.\\nSorry, it’s our policy.\\n[Bea] Store policy can’t really supersede state law. Please, it’s an emergency.\\nCaramel latte for Miranda.\\nHoney, I’m about to order. Do you want your usual?\\n[Bea] Uh.\\nMy wife would like a double espresso although you’ve had trouble sleeping lately, right babe? Maybe we should back it off to a single. You kept the light on until like midnight last night.\\n[Bea] I did, didn’t I? Yeah, so maybe I’ll just have a peppermint tea with two sugars. Thanks, husband.\\nOh, and the bread. It’s grilled cheese night. And she is part of the purchasing class, so can we get the bathroom key? Thank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you. That was really nice.\\nHappy to. You knew a lot about bathroom law.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] It was a short chapter. Thank you.\\nOh. I’ll have your tea waiting for you. Can’t leave my wife.\\n[Bea] Oh. Okay. That’s great. I will see you on the other side.\\n\\n[Bea] Hallie, I just met this guy and I don’t know, it was something. Well, I know it’s been a while, but I’m pretty sure he bought me a tea and he might have just stolen my coat. But what do I do? Oh no, this is the time that I’m supposed to be meeting people and doing things. Hallie, I gotta call you back. God damn it.\\nAre you okay?\\n[Bea] Big time. I am big time okay. I just had to pee for like the last six hours and I just started this new internship. And I didn’t want to ask anyone where the bathroom was because I didn’t want them to think I was weak and not a problem solver.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. Every human does it. It’s very, very normal.\\nYeah.\\nPeppermint tea, two sugars.\\n[Bea] Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Hi.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nOh, hey. You…\\n[Bea] So are you going to ask me out now?\\nYeah. Yeah, I am. I’m Ben.\\n[Bea] I’m Bea.\\n[Bea] So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, you would not be able to protect us?\\nNo, no. You’d be dead.\\n[Bea] You would let me die?\\nI’m not going to let you die. I’m just going to survive. You’re right. You’re right. You’re right.\\n[Bea] I was a gymnast.\\nGymnast?\\n[Bea] Yes. For like five years. I got like sixth place on beam.\\n\\n\\n\\nSixth place?\\n[Bea] Yes. Got a ribbon.\\nI’m impressed.\\n[Bea] Everybody gets a ribbon.\\nAll right, wait to cool down. You just saw me take it off the burning stove.\\n[Bea] Oh, my God.\\nIf you’re going to be a lawyer, you got to understand negligence and breach and McDonald’s versus that lady’s habeas corpus.\\n[Bea] You used none of those terms properly.\\nHow do you know? You’re not a lawyer yet. It’s not too late to choose a more noble profession.\\n[Bea] Oh, like you?\\nYou’re right. Stick with it. I’m going to need a lawyer at some point.\\n[Bea] I don’t even know if I want to be a lawyer. I cannot believe I just said that out loud. I’m sorry. My life is a disaster right now.\\nMight be turning the corner. You just met me.\\n[Bea] Or I might end up in a suitcase. I mean, look at this place. It looks like every serial killer reenactment documentary. Why do you have a giant wrench?\\nOkay, it wouldn’t be a suitcase. It’d be a carry-on because you’re zero feet tall. And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how broken something is, there’s always a way to fix it. I’m sorry. I don’t know why I’m talking to you about my mom right now.\\n[Bea] Alright. Then tell me about that.\\nThat is a long story. Everybody survived.\\n[Bea] Great.\\n[Bea] Holly, I don’t know this guy. He’s fucking great.\\nYo, let’s go, Benny. Come on, cupcake. We’re gonna be late.\\n‘Sup, Pete.\\nNo way. You cooked? That girl you blew me off for stayed over?\\n[Bea] He asked me out and then I kind of asked him out and then we just walked around the city and we fell asleep talking. I don’t– I left before you could wake up. I don’t know why. Why did I? What the fuck am I doing? Okay, I love you. Bye. I’m so sorry I woke you up. I didn’t– This whole thing is so new to me. Bye.\\nYou got cheese and bread. You didn’t miss one ingredient. What you doing with that? Why you got the giant wrench? You told her about your mom, bro? You don’t tell nobody about your mom. Fuck, dog. You in love, man. About fucking time, man. My boy’s in love.\\nFuck that. I couldn’t get her out of here fast enough. This girl’s a disaster. She’s a nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIX MONTHS LATER\\nWant to get a mansion, a jacuzzi, a theater to watch my movies, a couple whips and lots of fancy things.\\nThe kids, they call the goonies.\\nI see the future crystal ball, mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall.\\nGot your girlfriend screaming all the cops.\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nClaudia.\\nHolly.\\nThere we go.\\nHey, what’s up, Glee?\\nBen, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.\\nAre we saying that now?\\nYeah, is that cool?\\nYeah, I mean, I don’t really like labels, but I like you a whole bunch. I like your friend a whole bunch. And if she wants to put a label on me, then she can sew it on wherever she wants. That was weird. That was weird. I’m not into S&M or anything like that, unless you are, which would be totally cool, you know? You do you.\\nWell, she really likes you, too. And that is very rare for her.\\nOh, look who’s talking.\\nHow’s the crowd in here tonight?\\nOver there, big boy.\\nOh, B.\\nDo ladies like dumplings? We just had the greatest dumplings.\\nPete, meet my sister. This is Pete, Claudia’s brother.\\n[Bea] Nice to meet you.\\nAnd Ben. Ben. This is Ben. We all grew up together.\\nHey.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nYou two know each other?\\nYeah, we met.\\n[Bea] Barely.\\nWow, that’s so random.\\n[Bea] I’m going to go grab a drink.\\nDoor’s that way if you’re looking to sneak out. I know that’s your thing.\\n[Bea] Well, I am a disaster.\\nLet’s go away from this.\\nYeah.\\nSo you a lawyer yet?\\n[Bea] Why? Do you need a defense attorney?\\nI’m just curious how you passed the class on ethics and not bailing on people.\\nI think that’s the jerk who B got with when she was on her break from Jonathan.\\nNo way. So B’s the coffee girl who ghosted him?\\nI thought she looked familiar, but I don’t see faces. I just see souls.\\nAt least he made her realize that Jonathan was the one.\\n[Bea] I’m engaged now.\\nGood for you. Where are you registered? I’ll buy you a broomstick.\\n[Bea] I’ll send you an invite. You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?\\nYou do remember. See, it did mean something to you.\\n[Bea] You’ll always be my rock bottom. The night I spent with a bitch.\\nDid she just call him a bitch?\\nYou think they’re going to physically fight?\\nOr fuck?\\nThat’s a fine line.\\n[Bea] Let’s just get through tonight for them, OK?\\nElle, she’s your sister. I’m sure the relationship won’t last long.\\n[Bea] She’s your friend. I question why they’re even together.\\nThen I’m going to get a drink and toast to never seeing you again.\\n[Bea] Cheers to that, bro.\\n\\nANYONE BUT YOU\\nSo before I pronounce this newlywed couple, if anyone has an issue with these two wonderful people joining together in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.\\nI have an objection.\\nLeo, don’t do this.\\nI have to, Annie. It’s just not right. There’s no way I can bless this union without their friends and family joining us to celebrate in Australia.\\nWe’re getting married in Sydney.\\n\\nWelcome on board. 2K to the front.\\nThank you, Sheryl.\\n51E, how long’s the flight?\\n16 hours. 51F, thanks. 73F, all the way to the back.\\nHey. Head of the wedding?\\n[Bea] Of my sister, yes, I am.\\nHow crazy is it that we’re on the same plane?\\n[Bea] Don’t think there’s thousands of flights flying to Sydney every day.\\nOh, there’s quite a few, actually. Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, some co-chairs. Serendipity, I guess.\\n[Bea] I don’t think that word means what you think it means.\\nSo where’s your fiance? Wait, is this him? Hey, I’m Ben. I was her hall pass on your break.\\nWhat?\\nOh my god, I forgot. Claude told me you dumped him. Did you sneak out on your wedding day?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Wow, you are a child.\\nIt’s a pretty long flight. Do you want anything from the front of the boat? Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?\\n[Bea] No, thank you. I’m all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.\\nNothing small about me.\\nWhat the fuck?\\nHave a good flight. See you there.\\n\\nWhy do so many of us feel stuck? How is it even a very successful? Often feel like there is something missing from their lives. Why do so many people spend years mystically thinking about choices they might have made? One answer to that problem, many of us are leading lives that are misaligned with our own deepest values and preferences.\\nThank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain. What psychology can teach us about living our most authentic lives?\\n[Bea] What the fuck?\\n\\nHey, Vinny! Vindale! OK, Vin, looking good.\\nThanks for picking me up, dude.\\nNot just you, my guy.\\nSpelling Bee!\\n[Bea] Hey!\\nOur sisters are getting married. How dope is that?\\n[Bea] I know, I’m so excited.\\nOh, great. All right, let’s hit it.\\nThank you. I hope all of you have a wonderful vacation. I wish you all the best for the Mid-Autumn Festival.\\nBye.\\nY’all ready for Australia?\\nCan’t wait for y’all to see where we stay. And the plan is so dope.\\nWe’re all staying at the same place?\\nYep, my stepdad’s house. Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.\\n[Bea] Sounds like a piece of information that could have been shared a little earlier.\\nWell, that’s because they think you guys hate each other, so they didn’t want to poke the beard.\\n\\nNot bad, right?\\nYou don’t even play tennis.\\nI know, but I feel sweet.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee, y’all.\\nMeet Kalonabee.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee.\\nAll over.\\nAll over.\\nSpin, spin, spin.\\nWoo-hoo!\\nHe was the only member of the family who was trans.\\nYeah, he was there.\\n[Bea] Whoa.\\nYou’re right. This place is insane.\\nI know. All right, let’s get some sand under your feet.\\nHave you guys made up?\\nAll good.\\n[Bea] We’re fine if he just stays away from me.\\nDon’t need an invitation for that.\\n[Bea] I think you do if you’re like this. You can’t leave me alone.\\nSame reason I slowed down at the car crash.\\nOkay, so you guys buried the hatchet, water under the bridge, two adults adulting like fucking adults.\\nOh, we did have a little bit of a last minute snafu though. You guys are gonna have to share a room. There’s only one bed, but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.\\nShe’s kidding.\\n[Bea] You’re funny. I can’t wait any longer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWait for me!\\nHallie’s such a goof.\\nShe’s good for you. She could use some spontaneity.\\nHey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.\\nI hope so. I have a million contingencies and scenarios for everything. And honestly, I just want this wedding to be beautiful because I love the shit out of her and I just wanna marry the bitch, you know what I’m saying?\\nYou’re such a romantic.\\nHey, don’t be mad at me, but Margaret’s here.\\nWhy would I be mad? She lives here, I was 100% expecting to see her.\\nYeah. Margaret, Margaret, look who’s here.\\nThere she is. 100%.\\nGo rip off the band-aid.\\nBabe!\\nHow’s it going, stranger?\\nI was hoping you’d come. I wanted to message you, but I didn’t know how you’d feel about hearing from me.\\nAre you kidding?\\n[Bea] I’m never leaving.\\nNever leave.\\n[Bea] How are mom and dad?\\nThey’re good. You know, mom now thinks she’s Australian and dad’s not at all pointing out every tiny little detail that’s different. They’re also a little worried how you’re gonna react to all this.\\n[Bea] What are you talking about?\\nWell, you know, everybody thought that you’d be the one getting married first. You always used to talk about your wedding growing up. You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress when I just used it to dress like a mummy, you know?\\n[Bea] Hallie, stop. That’s not me anymore. I’m free now. I’m deprogrammed. That does not mean I don’t support you and your misguided view that soulmates exist.\\nThat’s sweet. Is that gonna be your toast?\\n[Bea] You and Claudia are the exception. I’m really happy for you, for real. What’s going on over there?\\nThat’s Claudia’s cousin. She visited the States a few years back. They dated. No biggie. Broke up with him. Crushed his heart.\\nNo way, that man does not have a heart.\\nFeels like forever ago. We were babies.\\nI’m really happy you’re here. We can reconnect as maybe not babies.\\nI would love that. Beau! Come eat my mate. Ben, this is my partner, Beau.\\nHi, mate.\\nLike, tennis partner?\\nSometimes after. How do you two dags know each other?\\nWe had a bit of a go back when, didn’t we?\\nDid you now? Good on ya. Hey, we’re gonna go trotting this weekend. Hit up the turps out here, eh? It’s gonna be a cracker. Woo!\\nYou know it.\\nGreat guy.\\nYeah.\\n\\nMommy!\\nHey, Beatrice.\\n[Bea] Dad!\\nYou made it.\\nOh, baby.\\nHi, baby.\\nHi, honey.\\nOh, my God.\\nWow.\\nHow’s our future lawyer?\\n[Bea] Great.\\nGreat.\\n[Bea] How’s the trip been?\\nOh, magical. The Australians are all wonderful. And excuse me, but good looking.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nWhy are they so weird about their plugs? I mean, this place is basically America. They speak English, they eat regular food, they have a complicated relationship with their past.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI’m doing okay.\\n[Bea] I’m doing great. My big sister’s getting married.\\nCould have been you. Could still be you someday.\\nHave you heard from Jonathan? Did he call or anything?\\nWell, that didn’t take long.\\nWe’re just torn up that he’s not part of our family anymore.\\nI mean, he works at our house every night from like 11 years old. He was basically family. Was about to be actual family.\\n[Bea] If I never ask you for anything ever again, can you please just lay off of me this weekend?\\nI just want both of our daughters to be happy.\\n[Bea] I’m very happy, but not when you guys do this.\\nNed, you in the right direction? He’s such a great guy. Just think on it, yeah?\\n\\nBee, dinner at 7.30, okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Yeah.\\nBen, all set for dinner, yeah?\\nYeah, I’ll be there.\\n\\nI was plagiarizing.\\nHey!\\nHi Ben!\\nHey Ben!\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nEverybody?\\nDad’s speech.\\nOh yes, right, okay. We’re gonna make this short, because you’ve all traveled a bloody long distance, and Carol and I are so appreciative. Biggest thing we’ve missed since coming back from the States is not seeing our kids. And you lot, our extended family, so we’re just over the moon to have a full house before the wedding on Sunday.\\nWhere we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia, setting off on this crazy thing called life. And of course, Innie and Leo, our new family.\\nWell, we’re just so grateful, not only for your incredible hospitality, but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.\\nSo as they say in our country, abondanza.\\nCheers!\\nNow baby.\\nWow!\\nWhat classes are you loving? Have you given any more thought to tort law? ‘Cause class action is really where it’s at right now. What does Jonathan say? He knows you pretty well. What does he think you should do?\\n[Bea] Mom.\\nOkay.\\nI can’t even remember why we put you in the truck again. We didn’t put her in the trunk, she stowed away in the trunk.\\nYeah, I wanted to go with you guys to see Cinderella.\\nWe were going to Coachella.\\nI know that now, it was nice.\\nAll right, everyone. So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy. Let’s just have a moment to calm ourselves. I am not looking at anybody in particular, but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.\\nCrown chakra.\\nLet’s hit that cobra.\\nCleanse, get that weasel.\\nOkay.\\nGo!\\nYou go, you go.\\nSign of the times.\\nAll right, all right, four words.\\nFirst word, the, A, of, if.\\nAnimosity, hate, liar.\\nFive words.\\n[Bea] No, just shut the fuck up.\\nThe Bible.\\nA woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality to take advantage of other people.\\nMom, focus, okay? Right here, right here.\\nThis is a white people’s game. Y’all spend so much time trying to trick each other. Y’all got so much time on your hands. Just say the word.\\nIt’s on the extreme.\\nGrumpy old man.\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nOkay, okay, yeah, okay.\\n[Bea] Fuck boy.\\nOld cat woman.\\n[Bea] Your ego.\\nOkay.\\nWhat is this?\\n[Bea] Wait, no props.\\nNo one cares, no one can see us.\\n[Bea] Cheaters are shocking.\\nSays the woman who cheated on her fiance.\\n[Bea] We were on a break, asshole.\\nYou’re either broken up for good, or you’re cheating. Either way, someone’s lying to someone.\\n[Bea] I must have really gotten under your skin.\\nRoger, what is this?\\nFat, five.\\nWhat is the thing I’m holding in my hand?\\nFireworks.\\nFireworks by Katy Perry.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] That is not fair.\\nHey, what, you’re not fair. What’s wrong with you? Just stop.\\n[Bea] What are you doing?\\nWhat is wrong with you?\\n[Bea] Stop.\\nOh God.\\nOh God.\\nSam, what the?\\nOh my God.\\nAli.\\nGet back.\\nSam.\\nRoger.\\nI’ve got this.\\nThat’s some gangster shit right there.\\nSorry.\\n[Bea] Sorry.\\n\\nThey’re going to ruin our wedding.\\nAll that matters is that we’re together.\\nIt’s true.\\nLook baby, I love you to the moon and back, but those two fuckwads are going to destroy our weekend, and our memories, which we are going to have for a very long time, are headed straight over a cliff.\\nIt’s going to be fine baby, we just have to. to stand there and profess our love.\\nIt seems to me, their animus only surfaced after they spent a night together. Am I accurate?\\nThat’s usually how it goes, honey.\\nWe crumple our feelings into a ball and shove ’em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.\\nThe solution appears to be simple then. We return them to the night they were spent.\\nLike we trick them into falling in love with each other?\\nHe didn’t say anything about love, honey. We just need to get them to jump each other’s bones.\\n\\nYeah, come on!\\nThat was good, right?\\nThat was good.\\nYou go, you go, you go, you go, you go.\\nShe clearly has eyes for Ben.\\nWho does, father?\\nHallie Spence, the sister. The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.\\nYou can’t say that. What the hell?\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that was rude. I apologize to anyone that was listening, which can only be you, Pete, ’cause you’re the only person that was listening. I apologize.\\nI accept your apology and will now move on. Do you know Bea’s been in love with Ben since the first night they met?\\nWell, why didn’t she tell him? You know, when I was a young bloke and I liked a girl, I would sneak up behind her and I’d cut a lock of her hair and then I’d smack her on the bum!\\nWhat the hell?\\nI don’t know, I’m not good at this, sorry.\\nBea was just too scared to tell him, but I’ve talked to her and she says she regrets walking out that morning.\\nTell me more, son.\\nWhy me?\\nBecause you’re really good at it, right? You can do it.\\nWhy me, why? Why you put this hat on me? No one can see me, it’s a radio play, motherfucker. Bea wants us to tell him how much she likes him, so he lets his guard down and goes to her. Some Cupid’s killed with arrows and some with traps.\\nThat was good, I like that, that’s good.\\nI just made it up.\\nSo, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers, and say, “Come to Papa.”\\nWhat are you doing?\\nI’m from a different generation.\\nAnd your generation sucks. You fucked up the whole world for us.\\nAnd I’m full of shame. But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.\\nBut Ben feels awful that he called her a disaster. I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.\\nThen why is he fighting with her?\\nWell, because he likes her.\\nAnd I know that Bea likes Ben. She’s just denying herself because she’s got in her head somehow that she’ll never love again.\\nWhoa, I’m not talking about love, baby. I’m talking about dick.\\nOh, it’s Ben.\\nOh.\\nHey. You.\\n[Bea] Oh God, they got to you too?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia say how much I like you?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really?\\nIt was Pete and Roger.\\n[Bea] Fantastic, it’s a team effort. They’re trying to get us together.\\nNo way.\\n[Bea] Come here.\\nOh, maybe they want us to stop acting like assholes so we don’t ruin the biggest event of their lives.\\n[Bea] Us? There is no us and assholes. You’re the one who destroyed the living room.\\nWould you two mind helping me with something? I hate to ask, but I’d really appreciate it.\\nSure.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\n\\nSo Roger left his sunglasses on the sailboat. I swear, if his head wasn’t screwed on, we’d use it as a bowling ball. Do me a favor and swim out and get them. It’s the one on the right.\\nBoth of us.\\n[Bea] Is that really a two person job?\\nDoesn’t seem like it.\\nYou two. Yeah.\\n[Bea] All right, so everyone’s involved in this.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] I feel bad.\\nMe too.\\n[Bea] I don’t want to bum Holly and Claudia out.\\nJust me and you.\\n[Bea] Can you not swim?\\nI’m an excellent swimmer.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of breath?\\nI’m fine. How much further do you think?\\n[Bea] Are your eyes closed?\\nI think it’s dark.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of shape? You have like a 10 pop.\\nI’m not out of shape. I’ve been to 295, 300 once. I just don’t do cardio.\\n[Bea] Oh my God, you’re hot girl fit.\\nI’m not hot girl fit.\\n[Bea] Okay, my bad. We’ll see you at the boat.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nI could have done it myself, but whatever. Thanks.\\n[Bea] No fucking way.\\nHoney, look who’s here.\\n[Bea] I cannot believe they did this.\\nWho is that?\\n[Bea] That is my ex, Jonathan.\\nHey, hey.\\nWhat is he doing here?\\n[Bea] My Black Hawk helicopter parents have been trying to get us back together for the past four months.\\nThey flew him halfway across the world to your sister’s wedding? That’s some deep off shit. They came to play.\\n[Bea] That’s my parents. They think I’m throwing my life away.\\nHoney, we’re just gonna take him back and get him all settled in.\\nI’ll see you later.\\n[Bea] You know, maybe we should do it. Just tell everyone we’re together.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] It would solve that problem for me and that problem for you.\\nI don’t have a problem.\\n[Bea] You clearly want Margaret.\\nNo, I don’t.\\n[Bea] Yes, you do. I saw the way you looked at her last night and I know she broke your heart. She sees you’re with me. She wants what she can’t have and then bye bye crocodile Jack. Fuck, he’s fast.\\nMaking her jealous is not gonna work. We’re not in seventh grade.\\n[Bea] Trust me, bro. We’re all in seventh grade when it comes to this stuff. They’ve already gone through all of the bullshit trying to trick us into each other’s arms. Let’s just embrace it.\\nThere’s no way we can convince anyone we actually like each other.\\n[Bea] Yeah, you’re right.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] You know, I still think about that night we spent together.\\nShut up.\\n[Bea] No, I’m serious. You know, this could be kind of fun. We’re at a wedding a million miles away from home. Who knows what could happen under the cover of a masquerade. And that night at your place, no matter how it ended, it was still pretty amazing. … Convincing enough?\\nFuck it. Let’s do it. … Just wait. Wait.\\nOkay, okay. Whoever wants to go on the hike, we need to leave now. We’re running behind schedule.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nBabe, the mountains have been there for millions of years. A few more minutes isn’t gonna hurt them.\\nBaby, I know you are trying to calm me down and I love you for it. Thank you. But I am hurting cats right now and I need some help instead of this easy breezy Martin Scorsese.\\nAw, jitters. Remember our wedding?\\nOnly that you’re the most beautiful bride on God’s green earth.\\nRight answer.\\nWe’re coming, we’re coming, we’re coming.\\nJinx, you owe me a cup.\\nOh, you have a little something in your teeth.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.\\nYeah, let me just take that out.\\nOh, I gotta get it out.\\nOh, it’s right there.\\nGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.\\nHoney, here he is.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] Jonathan.\\nSo nice to see you.\\n[Bea] I had no idea you were coming.\\nSo your parents didn’t tell you, okay? Yeah, you know, the first thing I asked them when they invited me was, “Does B know?” ‘Cause otherwise this would be really fucking awkward. And now it is fucking awkward.\\nNo, no, not at all.\\nI’m in a lot of love.\\nNo, you’re like family. It’d be effing awkward if you weren’t here.\\nI’m so glad you’re here.\\nI’m so happy for you two. Hey, congratulations.\\nYeah, thanks.\\nRight?\\n[Bea] It’s great to see you.\\nIt’s great to see you too.\\nWe’re all going on a hike, so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out. Let’s move out.\\n[Bea] Ben, meet Jonathan.\\nOh, hey, man.\\nI’m Ben.\\nHey, oh, Pete and Claudia’s friend, right?\\nAlso friends with Bea, among other things.\\nYeah, it’s nice to meet you.\\nOkay, plenty of enough time in the car to do whatever the fuck this is. Come on, let’s go!\\nYeah, okay. Yeah.\\n[Bea] We need to come up with a game plan.\\nYeah, you are so terrible at this.\\n[Bea] What?\\nWe’re doing this thing!\\nHoney, I’m sorry. I know we should have asked you, but we had to invite you.\\nOh, it’s totally fine. I’m glad he’s here. I love him and Holly loves him.\\nReally?\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nGreat, okay. So we’re spending a little time together away from the real world and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, Mom, guys, no. I totally forgot to tell you, but I’m with Ben. … Do you want to come?\\nI think I’m going to hang back and yell at your parents. Have fun.\\n\\nAlright, so is it like we just got together or we’ve been sneaking around? Oh, I got it. What if we ran into each other at Chipotle, lady in the tramp, the burrito?\\n[Bea] No.\\nThis can’t be that hard.\\n[Bea] It’s harder than you think. My parents don’t even believe it yet.\\nYou told them five seconds ago.\\n[Bea] They know I would never go out with a guy like you.\\nYou’ve been with one guy your entire life.\\n[Bea] Jonathan’s a better man than you’ll ever be.\\nAnd yet you left him. Which is why exactly? Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.\\n[Bea] Okay, you don’t know my boxes and you never will. Just figure this out, please.\\nOkay. We just suck face in front of everybody. Half of them think they set us up anyway.\\n[Bea] No, that’s too much. We need to do something that’s more hidden so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.\\nYou’re calling me a fuckboy like it’s an insult? I own that shit.\\n[Bea] Let’s just be affectionate. I know it’s a foreign concept for you.\\nI can be affectionate. I’ll affectionate the shit out of you.\\nI can’t believe your parents invited Jonathan. Now I have to find a table to sit him at.\\nWhat about Bea?\\nNo, no, she’s fine. She’s sitting with us at our table.\\nNo, I’m talking about how she’s already at a low point because she’s going through a breakup and I don’t even know what’s happening with school. She never even talks about it anymore.\\nI guess I could put up with the cousins.\\nWhy?\\nYou alright?\\nOh, shit.\\nWow.\\nCheck it out, guys!\\nNice!\\nYeah!\\nBeautiful!\\nSee, I told you it was going to be good.\\nMan, that’s nice.\\n[Bea] Oh, wow.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] So beautiful.\\nThere it is.\\nFeel the serenity.\\nPretty spectacular, hey?\\nIt’s amazing.\\n[Bea] Alright, your turn.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] This is just so romantic.\\nOkay, nuzzle my neck.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nGet in there. Damn, you are short.\\n[Bea] You are not tall enough to say that.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Oh, are you ticklish?\\nNo, I’m acting.\\n[Bea] Like a toddler?\\nNo, go away. Okay, I can use that.\\n[Bea] Beg me. Beg me to stuff you in the butt.\\nStop! Just let me do it. Permission to put my left hand on your right buttock.\\n[Bea] Granted. Too hard.\\nSorry. You gotta sell it.\\n[Bea] Okay, not in circles. It’s not a magic lamp.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Okay, now you’re just playing bop it.\\nI’ve never rubbed a bopper show.\\n[Bea] Clearly, you’ve tried. Are you not wearing underwear?\\nIt’s a swimsuit. I’m on holiday.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nOkay, just mind the gap.\\n[Bea] How’s that?\\nThat’s good. Just like, but you don’t have to hover. Just kind of, oh, man the woods.\\n[Bea] I’m sorry.\\nOkay, just take it out.\\n[Bea] You try.\\nYou want me to stick my finger in my own ass? How’s that gonna convince? Oh, on you. I can’t. Jesus Christ, it’s like a vacuum pack down here. How’d you get in this thing? Oh, man, it’s tight. Oh, see, it’s like holding a baby bird.\\n[Bea] God damn it.\\nWere they not watching this whole time?\\n[Bea] You like a mole or something on your butt?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really? ‘Cause I feel something.\\nI don’t have a mole. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Are there any more on me?\\n[Bea] I don’t know.\\nJack, spiders hunt bears. They hunt bears.\\nNo pictures. Put the cameras down. We’re not gonna take a spirit.\\nAre there any more?\\n[Bea] I don’t know.\\nWhere are they? I feel it. I feel it.\\n[Bea] I think I see something.\\nWhat do you see? What do you see?\\n[Bea] Oh, no, that’s just a part of you. You’re fine.\\nAll right, look, if I have one of those little fuckers in me, they might be in you.\\n[Bea] I’m good.\\nThat’s probably a better way to check than what I did.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nAll right, little one, we join your journey. We do not inherit the earth. We just borrow it from our creatures.\\nHey, guys. What did we miss?\\nWow.\\n\\nWhy can’t I get this?\\nBecause you’re meant to learn to dive when you’re six.\\nYou got this, hon.\\nYou ever try focusing on your toes? My mom taught me this trick. If you pretend like there’s a string from your nose to your toes, you just kind of maintain that position. You mind doing it again? This time I’m going to shout out a tribute question. I think it’s just going to help clear your mind.\\nJust make sure it’s a question about airplanes or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\\nOkay, um, uh, what company created the Concorde?\\nA collaboration between British Airways and the French government. How’d I do?\\nYou’re good there.\\nMaybe your mom can teach him how to dive.\\nShe passed away.\\nOh, I’m so sorry.\\nYeah, sorry.\\nAll right, I’m going to go again, but this time give me one with a little shorter answer.\\nI have a better idea. You just let me do everything, I’ll guide you in. Don’t think.\\nBe careful of his shoulder.\\nYeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.\\nWouldn’t let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.\\nI had to tell her I love her. When you know she’s the one, nothing else matters.\\nI’m waving, thank you, thank you.\\nThere you go.\\nDid I do it?\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Good job, babe.\\nYour dad’s a natural.\\n[Bea] I’m so glad you guys got to spend some time with Ben.\\nAre you two really…\\n…getting to know each other in a very respectful manner? One befitting such a kind and intelligent woman as your daughter.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are in the early stages.\\nNot too early.\\n[Bea] But also not so advanced.\\nJust that magical moment when two people come together in this crazy journey we call life.\\n[Bea] That’s why I was so worried when Jonathan showed up. I don’t want to hurt his feelings.\\nI even suggested we hide our light under a bushel for his sake.\\n[Bea] But our love is just so strong. And I know what you guys are thinking. He’s much older.\\nThey weren’t, right? Probably thinking I’m 27, early 28s.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are very happy.\\nHappiest.\\n[Bea] Yep.\\nYou know, you looked like that back in the day.\\nNo, I didn’t. That guy’s made out of cobblestone.\\nThey’re holding hands.\\nI think it’s working.\\nI can’t believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.\\n[Bea] Was that bullshit about your mom?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] The story about the giant wrench. I thought it might have been a lie until all your one night nothings.\\nYou ever heard that too?\\n[Bea] Like, I didn’t mean… I’m sorry. And it wasn’t a lie.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so nice to my dad. You should probably rinse off. You have his SPF a billion on you now.\\nCheers, mate. I’ll just grab a quickie.\\nOkay.\\nSo, Australia. What do you reckon, eh? How you finding it?\\nI don’t know. It’s great.\\nMaz goes on about you all the time. Ripper Cunt, she calls you.\\nMaz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is…\\nGood friend. Oh, yeah. You know you had a proper surf when sand gets all up your clacker. And your gobbler, too.\\nGobbler is…\\nYou know, your hog bonnet. You know, your beef cap. Come on, mate. You know, the anteater. Anyway, good to have ya. Gotcha.\\nG’day, love.\\nHey, mate. Fancy a game?\\n[Bea] You’re going down. How have you been doing?\\nPretty good. You?\\n[Bea] Okay, I guess.\\nHow’s school going? Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?\\n[Bea] You know me. I’ve never been one for practicing.\\nStill having second thoughts?\\n[Bea] Straight to third.\\nI know it’s weird, me being here, but believe me, I had nothing to do with it. Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.\\n[Bea] That’s sweet. You’re part of the family.\\nI’d be lying if I said I haven’t been thinking about you.\\n[Bea] Yeah, me too.\\nHow long have you and that guy, Ben, been?\\n[Bea] It’s kind of new. Not like new, new, but newish.\\nWell, I think he seems great.\\n[Bea] No, you don’t.\\nI really don’t.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so cool about all of this. Not just this, but this too.\\nIt’s really good to see you, Bea.\\n[Bea] I’m glad you’re here. Now let’s have fun.\\nLet’s do it.\\nMate.\\nThat’s me.\\nYou want a coffee? It’s the best in the world.\\nYou guys are really proud of your coffee here.\\nIt’s the best in the fucking world.\\nOkay.\\nEnjoy.\\nFuck, that is good.\\nI was thinking of going for a bit of a run later. Do you want to join?\\nI’m actually going on a bike ride with Bea, so I don’t think I can.\\nShe’s a little sweet on you, hey?\\nOh, you caught that.\\nHow long have you and Beau been together?\\nNah, we’re just banging about. He’s nice, but I think I’m looking for someone less casual. More romantic.\\nWow.\\nWhy did me and you ever break up anyway?\\nI don’t really remember, but I think you said something like I was an immature, drongo, smothered in ex body spray.\\nSmells like you’re not that guy anymore. Bea’s a lucky girl.\\nOh.\\nHey, open the door. Bea.\\n[Bea] What’s wrong?\\nMargaret thinks we’re together.\\n[Bea] That’s great.\\nNo, Margaret needs to think we’re the right type of together. Not together together, but like situationally together. ‘Cause if she thinks we’re together together, she’s not gonna break girl code. So we need to finesse our togetherness so that we’re together, but there’s an opening for our togetherness and she can just slide right in so that we can be together.\\n[Bea] Are you on Coke?\\nNo, it’s like coffee here. It’s like meth. I’m guessing. No, I’m not. I worked at Goldman. Partner’s wedding. Do what you do.\\n[Bea] Jesus, dude, who are you?\\nI’m a man trying to figure this out. Look at your room, it’s so much bigger. You got a painting? Wow, that’s so red. We have to kick it up a notch. Make it feel like we’re in the Gaga stage.\\n[Bea] What do you wanna do, take me in the hallway?\\nThat is not Gaga. Actually, that could be construed as Gaga. Tonight’s the rehearsal dinner, so we have to do something that makes it look like you’re into me, but you’re not into me. And I’m into you, but you can tell by my face that it’s never gonna mount.\\n[Bea] Get it together, man.\\nYou hit me so much.\\n\\nOkay, Kalana, now pretend this is a real fox that messed up our garden. Fuck it up. Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up. Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up. Fuck it up. Ooh. You see that?\\nHe did it, yeah. Oh, hey, they’re here. All right, everybody, wheels up.\\nHustle up.\\nBad dog.\\nYou look cute.\\nBaby, you look so good.\\nShe’s has been.\\nYou look so good.\\nYeah, I look bad.\\nMan, this is the best time to say that.\\nDaddy’s a dad.\\nCome on, let’s go.\\nYeah.\\nAll right, let’s do it.\\nThank you.\\nYou see the size of that boat?\\nHey, guys.\\nWoo!\\n[Bea] Nice touch.\\nNice dress.\\nYou have a good heart.\\nI love this dress.\\nYou look fine.\\nOh, thank you.\\nWhat would you like to drink?\\nWhat’s a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?\\nThree scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.\\nOh, thank you.\\nAll right.\\nYou remembered.\\nThat you can’t handle hard liquor? Yeah, the smell’s still not out of my car.\\nYou know I feel really bad about that. That was a fun night. That was a fun summer.\\nMarks! Marks, captain says that we can steer the ship.\\nOh, okay, I’m coming. Hang on, I’ve got heels on.\\nLook how lucky we are. On a boat sailing back and forth with no real transportation or reason.\\nOkay.\\nAnd look at you, Polly Pocket. You the belle of the boat.\\nHe didn’t remember me.\\nOh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?\\nNo, honey, that’s, yes, I think it might be. Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.\\nThere it is.\\nWell, at least that was subtle.\\n[Bea] Was it?\\nThis oddly reminds me of prom.\\n[Bea] The first or second time?\\nJonathan is just the most perfect guy.\\nHe’s like a son to us.\\nWell, that might be a problem, mate. They might not wanna shag a brother.\\nSo how’s it going? Can parents back off a little?\\n[Bea] How about you?\\nGame on.\\n[Bea] Can you even dance?\\nYou just let me lead.\\n[Bea] Oh, God.\\nLet’s go.\\nIs Margaret watching?\\nIt’s a little hard to tell what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.\\nEverybody to the top deck, we about to do a champagne toast.\\n[Bea] Come with me.\\nSo what are we doing?\\n[Bea] Closing the deal. Titanic me.\\nWhat?\\nOh, help yourself to some champagne.\\nOh, thank you.\\nGrab some drinks.\\nOh, great.\\nNice.\\n[Bea] Titanic me.\\nNo, that is so lame.\\n[Bea] Exactly. The only people who would do something this lame are the ones who know how lame it is, but are in the first stages of liking each other, so they’re totally comfortable in their mutual lameness. Toast me.\\nOh my God.\\n[Bea] Come on.\\nThis is so cringe. So is saying cringe, old man.\\n[Bea] Lift my arms.\\nI’ve seen the movie.\\n[Bea] Have you?\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nThis is never gonna work.\\nAww! That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!\\nAre they doing Titanic?\\nAww!\\n[Bea] Are they watching?\\nYep.\\n[Bea] Are they buying it?\\nCan’t imagine they would.\\nIt’s real. We did it.\\nWe’re good. We’re really bloody good.\\nJonathan, have you seen Tasmania?\\nInya, I’m fine. It’s fine.\\nCan I do the line? That’s king of the world. You’re king of the world.\\n[Bea] Jack, I’m flying!\\nOkay, we can stop there.\\nWe can stop there.\\nThey’re gone. Show’s over.\\nOh my god!\\n[Bea] No! Wait for me! Help! Wait! Wait!\\nBae! Bea! Are you okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Why’d you jump in?\\nTo save you!\\n[Bea] But you’re a terrible swimmer!\\nI’m a great swimmer! Just short distances.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna die.\\nWe’re not gonna die.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna get hypothermia.\\nThe water’s 90 degrees.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna get eaten by sharks. Fuck! We’re gonna get eaten by sharks!\\nWe are gonna be fine. And we spent ten hours shredding water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.\\n[Bea] Goldman?\\nYeah, it was a partner’s kids bar mitzvah. A little bit of crack.\\nOh my god!\\nRoger!\\nOh my god!\\nIt looks like they’re going full Titanic. I love the commitment!\\nStop the boat!\\nNo, no, no.\\nHelp!\\nThey’re coming!\\nStay calm!\\nThis is not a very good swim.\\nBei!\\nThere.\\n[Bea] Are you sure?\\nYeah. Come on.\\nWhy aren’t we turning the boat around?\\nWe are in too shallow of water. We’ll run aground.\\nBut harbour rescue has been notified.\\nCome on.\\nAre you good?\\n[Bea] Mm-hmm.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] All right. Okay.\\nLet’s go.\\n[Bea] All right, get in the row.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] That was, um, probably the most– I mean, if you didn’t close it with Margaret, I don’t– There’s nothing more romantic than jumping in to save me.\\nYeah, well, Jonathan didn’t do it, that’s for sure. Your parents half the clock, that’s shit.\\n[Bea] You didn’t even give him a chance.\\nWhy do you keep defending this guy? Why do you break up with him in the first place?\\n[Bea] It’s complicated.\\nIt’s never complicated. What, he cheated on you? Drug problem? Did you catch him measuring his dick with a ruler app?\\n[Bea] We never fought.\\nIsn’t that a good thing?\\n[Bea] It was just comfortable. And he’s a great guy, which means there’s no one out there for me because I had the best one. I couldn’t even tell him I quit law school. And I have no idea what I’m gonna do with my life. We’re gonna get eaten by sharks, I had to tell somebody.\\nNo one else knows?\\n[Bea] I don’t think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.\\nYou finally did it.\\n[Bea] What?\\nYou know, one night you said you didn’t want to be a lawyer anyways.\\n[Bea] You remember that?\\nIt was a memorable night, until you snuck out, of course. Why did you?\\n[Bea] Because you scared the shit out of me. It was the first time in my life that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.\\nI know a little bit about that. I was really hurt when you left. So I said all that terrible stuff about you to Pete. That’s not how I felt.\\n[Bea] Look at us. Just a couple of fucked up people floating in the middle of the harbor. Promise me if we make it out alive we’ll go see that from dry land.\\nIt’s a pretty killer view from here.\\n[Bea] It’s dumb but I want to see the people. Landmarks like those are full of people in love. Marriage proposals, honeymooners, romantics jumping off of moving trains just to see the building with the person they love.\\nLike your dad in the Eiffel Tower?\\n[Bea] He told you that?\\nNothing else matters when it comes to love.\\n[Bea] You could use a bit of that right now.\\nIt’s not dumb. You, me and the opera house. It’s a date. I promise.\\n[Bea] What’s wrong?\\nI’m a little afraid of flying.\\n[Bea] Don’t you fly all the time for your job?\\nI have a very specific routine. I mask, headphones, build my bubble.\\nThat’s my Serenity song. How do you know my Serenity song?\\n[Bea] Don’t worry about it.\\n[Bea] You all good?\\nShut the fuck up now!\\nThanks again.\\nStay out of the water, yeah?\\nWant some coffee?\\n[Bea] Not the stuff from here. I’ll be up all night.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Thanks for kind of saving me though.\\nIt was fun.\\n[Bea] Stupid, but fun.\\nWell, that’s the best kind.\\n\\nNo, no, no, it’s hot!\\n[Bea] I’m warm.\\nWhen are you ever gonna learn? Like, you want me to blow on it? … Is it still hot?\\nWe’re getting pretty good at faking it.\\n[Bea] I don’t even know what’s real anymore. Everything I do just feels like a mistake.\\nBen, Steve, are you guys all right?\\nBen, wait, you hear?\\nI can’t hear you.\\nSteve!\\nBeatrice! Beatrice!\\n\\nHoney, what are these? Is that a handprint?\\nNo.\\nCome on, baby gorgeous. We got chores. Come on, let’s go. Ben, are you ready? We got groom stuff to do.\\nDude, I’m coming, I’m coming.\\nMan, I hope you scrub from top to bottom, ’cause who knows what was in that heart rate.\\nI also showered last night.\\nTwo showers in eight hours? Go off, King, get clean!\\n[Bea] Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?\\nYes, I’m so excited to marry Claudia. But, you know, I’m also hosting a party where it feels like we’re all playing parts in a play, and I’m not really into the pageantry, and I kinda just wanna do a little–\\n[Bea] All that matters is that you and Claudia run for the rest of your lives together.\\nI love you.\\n[Bea] I love you too.\\nBae? Hey, you’re still good to get the cake, right?\\n[Bea] Yes, ma’am.\\nAwesome. I put Margaret on it with you, just to be safe.\\n[Bea] Margaret.\\n\\nAll right, talk to me, baby. Who’s it gonna be, Margaret or Bae?\\nCome on, man, don’t give me that.\\nWe’re just two girls talking. I get it, though. It’s tough. Magpie’s your dream girl. She’s confident, beautiful, and she knows how to put out a fire with her attire. Now Bae’s waxing her other hand. Whoo! She’s smart, funny, quick, and she got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of.\\nPeter.\\nWhat? I’m not objectifying Margaret, man. That’d be inappropriate. That’s my cousin.\\nIt’s inappropriate with Bae too.\\nThis is deeper than I thought. Hey, Sydney! My boy is in love!\\nStop, dude, just stop.\\nWhat?\\nI know what you’re doing. I know what you’ve all been doing. You set us up, and we went along with it. But it’s fake.\\nIt was my stepdad, right? He can’t act for shit.\\nYou suck too, bro.\\nThat’s foul, dog. It’s definitely gotta be Bae, man.\\nI don’t know, man. I don’t fucking know. She doesn’t know what she wants. She’s single for basically the first time in her life. She just quit law school. Her fucking fiancé’s here.\\nMan, stop with all the white boy–\\nWhat the–\\nHey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Seriously. Anytime something gets real, you run away, call yourself a fuckboy, make an excuse, and you just move on to the next. It’s Bae. You jumped off a boat for her.\\nOh, that’s perfect.\\n[Bea] They’re gonna love it. Thank you so much.\\nLet me get this boxed up for you.\\nThank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nI don’t get all the pageantry of weddings. If you like someone, give ’em a snog. Keep it to yourselves.\\n[Bea] I wore a wedding dress for Halloween for five years in a row.\\nStop it.\\n[Bea] No, I know. It’s so pathetic. But I am with you now. This is not for me.\\nSo you and Ben aren’t serious?\\n[Bea] What? No, no, it’s just… we’re just situationally together.\\n‘Cause when I saw you last night in the harbor, I thought it might be more with you two.\\n[Bea] Just…situationally.\\nIs that an American thing?\\n[Bea] I don’t even know.\\nSo you’re right if I have a go at him, then? I feel like I might have made a mistake letting him loose. If that’s not okay, just tell me. For real.\\n[Bea] I know he really likes you.\\n\\nHow do you think I should play this with Ben? Should I wait until after the wedding?\\n[Bea] Um…I don’t know.\\nHave you guys hooked up?\\nHey.\\nWe’re Beatrice.\\nYou quit school?\\nYou’re just gonna pour gasoline on everything you’ve worked for?\\nIs there still time to re-enroll?\\nSoon as you broke up with Jonathan, everything turned to pot. Are you on drugs? Because at least then I’d understand.\\n[Bea] Who told you I quit law school? Was it Ben?\\nYou quit school?\\nWhat?\\nWhen were you gonna tell us?\\nIs this to get back at us? I’m sorry if we pushed you to succeed your whole life. We’re such awful parents.\\n[Bea] Mom, this isn’t about you.\\nYes it is. It is about us. And no, we’re not gonna let you throw away your life because you’re going through something. Everyone is always going through something. It’s called life.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] I can’t believe you. You told him I quit school?\\nNo, I didn’t.\\nYou told Pete. Pete told us.\\nShit.\\nI told you what?\\nYeah, no, I told Pete, but I didn’t mean it like that.\\nTold me what?\\nThat we’re gonna find out at some point.\\n[Bea] That’s not for you to decide.\\nI’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.\\nIt doesn’t matter how we found out.\\nFound out what?\\nShe quit law school.\\nOh, yeah, I knew that.\\n[Bea] You’re real shit.\\nI made a mistake. I’m sorry.\\n[Bea] There’s a reason why you’re alone. No one can trust you.\\nYeah, what’s your reason?\\n[Bea] Guys like you.\\nKeep telling yourself that.\\n[Bea] Fuck off.\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. Don’t do this right here, right now. I messed this all up. It’s all on me.\\nWhy don’t we all go for a swim, eh? Cool off before the wedding?\\nThat’s a great idea. Maybe early drinks?\\n[Bea] Guys, I am so sorry, but your plan is all ruined. We are not together. We were faking it the whole time.\\nYou knew?\\nWhat are they even talking about?\\nWell, we may have orchestrated a union between the pair of them in order for peace to prevail across the land.\\nYou lied to us? What have you been honest about lately?\\nSo you lied to me too? You’re not together?\\n[Bea] I could never be with someone like him.\\nYeah, ’cause I’m the one who fucked it up.\\n[Bea] You did fuck it up.\\nI fucked it up?\\n[Bea] Yeah, you fucked it up.\\nI fucked it up?\\n[Bea] You fucked it up.\\nOh, no.\\nBad dog, Kalonofin.\\nI mean, good dog, you killed that shit, but next time read the room, Kaymoney.\\n[Bea] I am so sorry.\\nHey, uh…\\nBae.\\nI think he’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine.\\n\\nGood?\\nYou’re perfect.\\nRelax, you’re working yourself up.\\nIt is not fine. It is not everything. It is fine. Okay, all we asked of them was to come out here, celebrate us, and they are ruining it.\\nAnd all week and I have been so stressed, and you’ve been more worried about what’s going on with bae than with me.\\nWell, you’ve been more concerned about your planning. Are you marrying me or your itinerary?\\nWell, if that’s how you feel, then why are we even doing this?\\nI don’t know. You tell me.\\n\\nThere’s one last thing we need to fake.\\nClaudia, Allie, we’re assholes.\\nWe’re really sorry.\\nI’m a terrible sister, and he’s a terrible friend.\\nIt’s your guys’ big day.\\nWe’re not gonna mess it up, we promise.\\nUh-huh, but just so you both know,\\nif you fuck up today, the something I borrowed\\nis a knife, and it’s shiny and new.\\nLove is intoxicating.\\nIt envelops you, it tickles you,\\nand it makes you feel like you can walk on air.\\nIt’s like this wind.\\nIt’s in your bones, it’s in your breath,\\nit’s in every beat of your heart.\\nYou can’t look for it, you can’t describe it,\\nand you can’t escape it.\\nAllie, I love you so much,\\nand I don’t think I say it enough.\\nYou are the yin to my yang,\\npeanut butter to my jelly,\\nand I will love you forever and always.\\nClaudia, I love you with so much of my heart\\nthat none is left to protest.\\nThat’s very good.\\nJust made it up.\\nA lot of it.\\nI now pronounce you married!\\nYeah!\\nOh, look, there she is.\\nOh, hey, parents.\\nIs that Tasmania?\\nYeah.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI am so sorry I lied to you guys about school.\\nI didn’t want to disappoint you guys again.\\nWell, if you’d just told us, maybe we could have–\\nTrying to talk me out of it?\\nNo, maybe we could have supported you.\\nI know this is scary for you guys.\\nYeah, it’s scary for me too,\\nand I gotta figure it out on my own.\\nI know that every now and then\\nwe might come off as a little…\\nControlling?\\nNo.\\nOverbearing?\\nNo.\\nActually crazy?\\nYes.\\nThat’s it, but only because we love you so much.\\nLove you.\\nGood luck.\\nGood luck.\\nHi, Aunt.\\nYes?\\nDo you mind if I steal a hand?\\nUh, not at all.\\nGo ahead.\\nHigh five.\\nHey.\\nHi.\\nWhere’s Bo?\\nHe buggered off.\\nHe said he saw a wave he couldn’t morally not surf.\\nI’m sorry.\\nIt was never really anything.\\nAnd you and Bea.\\nShe said you were just situational.\\nShe said that?\\nAre you good?\\nYeah, we know it’s been a tough weekend for you.\\nI don’t know.\\nThese last few days really made me realize how much I miss you.\\nWhy don’t you just go for a walk?\\nFigure your head.\\nYeah, we’ll go with you.\\nNo, we won’t.\\nNo.\\nI love you, but this is our wedding.\\nSo…\\nAre you sure?\\nYeah.\\nI might go and do some people watching.\\nJust not… these people.\\nThank you.\\nWow.\\nBen.\\nI wanted this for so long.\\nBut I think I’m just holding on to a memory.\\nAnd also, I… I’m sorry.\\nI’m so sorry.\\nI’ve never seen Bea like this before.\\nReally?\\nYou were the one who said there’s a thin line between love and hate.\\nYou’re always the first person to say that bit, you know?\\nI know it sounds crazy, but even when they were yapping at each other, I’ve never seen Bea happier.\\nSame with Ben.\\nHey, stepfather, may I have a word?\\nYes, but make it quick, son.\\nI promised my lady a dance, but don’t tell your mother.\\nYou’re so clever.\\nYou know who’s also clever?\\nBen.\\nYou know who else would be perfect for Ben?\\nThat mumbly girl who always looks like she’s got a secret.\\nYou know her name is Bea.\\nThat was a callback.\\nWill you stop?\\nStop.\\nHow you going, mate? How you going, Ben?\\nWhat, you two?\\nWhat?\\nJust enough with the loud talking and the overhearing.\\nJust stop.\\nBro, we literally didn’t know you were standing there.\\nYeah, it’s true.

I backed up.\\nI don’t want to be with Margaret.\\nI want to–\\nStop it.\\nYou gorgeous idiot.\\nRun. Don’t wait on love.\\nFight for it.\\nAnd don’t worry about the age difference.\\nI’m 29.\\nHoney, no one’s 29.\\nDo you know where she went?\\nShe said she wanted to walk around, do some people watching.\\nThat’s what she said?\\nPeople watching?\\nI think it was more of a euphemism for crying alone.\\nNo, it’s not.\\nI think I know where she might be.\\nGood God, man, go get her.\\nScour the city block by block.\\nScan the grid.\\nFirst north, south, then east, west.\\nLeo, I know exactly where she is.\\nIt makes it a lot easier.\\nI just need to find my moving train.\\nWhat’s going on here?\\nIs that coffee?\\nYeah.\\nOh, wait.\\nCall harbor rescue!\\nOh, my God!\\nOh, my God!\\nWhat the hell? Are you crazy?\\nPlease ask a favor!\\nWhy don’t you just treat people like my folks?\\nJust go get the girl.\\nThank you!\\nExcuse me!\\nExcuse me!\\nI didn’t kiss Margaret. She kissed me.\\nI know that’s a bullshit excuse, but it’s true.\\nI couldn’t find a moving train.\\nSorry, it’s the best I could do.\\nAre you out of your mind?\\nYeah.\\nBecause it’s been two years since we met\\nand I haven’t spent every single day with you.\\nThat’s the sign of a crazy person.\\nI hated you.\\nI didn’t really give you a choice.\\nI definitely didn’t hate you.\\nYou called me a bitch.\\nI said you were acting like a bitch.\\nNo, I was a bitch.\\nThe way I handled everything.\\nThe way I handled the first night.\\nThe way I handled last night.\\nYeah, it wasn’t really awesome.\\nWhy did you leave?\\nI thought you were going to regret it.\\nAnd I couldn’t face the idea of losing someone else that I… I really loved.\\nLast night was the first thing I haven’t regretted in a long time.\\nI love the way we fight.\\nI love how smart you are.\\nI love the weird way you stick your hands down my pants.\\nAnd I love how you know what you don’t want.\\nAnd if it’s not me, if I don’t check all your boxes,\\nif I’m not the one, I get it.\\nThat would really, really fucking suck.\\nSo, you gonna kiss me now?\\nYeah, I am.\\nThat’s a lot of running for Mr. No Cardio.\\nYeah, I’m dying.

              " '\\nBea, a law student with doubts about her path, connects instantly with the charming, yet arrogant, Ben on a whirlwind first date. Their passion cools overnight, however, leaving Bea heartbroken and fuming after overhearing Ben’s dismissive remarks to a friend. Years later, fate throws them together at a luxurious Australian wedding, forcing them to share space and endure awkward family gatherings – not helped by the presence of Bea’s persistent ex-fiancé and Ben’s jealous ex-girlfriend.\\nIn an attempt to ease the tension and ensure a smooth celebration, the wedding party hatches a mischievous plan: convince everyone Bea and Ben are a happy couple. Despite initial resistance, fuelled by personal motives, both agree to the charade. Bea seeks escape from her ex’s shadow, while Ben hopes to spark jealousy in his old flame.\\nAs they navigate the masquerade, participating in romantic couple activities and faking intimate moments, something unexpected happens. The line between pretense and reality blurs. Underneath the bickering and witty banter, they discover unexpected vulnerabilities and shared passions, leading to a genuine connection they can’t ignore.\\nTheir budding romance faces obstacles: Jonathan’s disapproval, Bea’s overbearing parents, and the inevitable exposure of their charade. But through humorous confrontations and self-reflection, they learn to trust each other and fight for their newfound love. In the end, defying expectations and overcoming external pressures, Ben and Bea choose to embrace their feelings, leaving the future open to exciting possibilities.\\nTheir journey is not just about finding love, but also about self-discovery. Bea sheds her insecurities and carves her own path, while Ben confronts his emotional walls and learns to be vulnerable. Their relationship, born from a playful ruse, blossoms into something authentic and true, reminding us that love can sometimes surprise us in the most unexpected places.\\n\\n* * *\\n[Bea] Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.\\n[Bea] Hi. Where’s your bathroom?\\nIt’s for customers only.\\n[Bea] Oh, okay. I’ll buy something.\\nYou gotta pay up there.\\n[Bea] Can I just go now? I really have to pee.\\nI’ve got a large cappuccino for Skylar.\\nThanks.\\n[Bea] I also kind of, well, no… I know that establishments that serve food or drink must be open to the public regardless of their purchasing class.\\nSorry, it’s our policy.\\n[Bea] Store policy can’t really supersede state law. Please, it’s an emergency.\\nCaramel latte for Miranda.\\nHoney, I’m about to order. Do you want your usual?\\n[Bea] Uh.\\nMy wife would like a double espresso although you’ve had trouble sleeping lately, right babe? Maybe we should back it off to a single. You kept the light on until like midnight last night.\\n[Bea] I did, didn’t I? Yeah, so maybe I’ll just have a peppermint tea with two sugars. Thanks, husband.\\nOh, and the bread. It’s grilled cheese night. And she is part of the purchasing class, so can we get the bathroom key? Thank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you. That was really nice.\\nHappy to. You knew a lot about bathroom law.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] It was a short chapter. Thank you.\\nOh. I’ll have your tea waiting for you. Can’t leave my wife.\\n[Bea] Oh. Okay. That’s great. I will see you on the other side.\\n\\n[Bea] Hallie, I just met this guy and I don’t know, it was something. Well, I know it’s been a while, but I’m pretty sure he bought me a tea and he might have just stolen my coat. But what do I do? Oh no, this is the time that I’m supposed to be meeting people and doing things. Hallie, I gotta call you back. God damn it.\\nAre you okay?\\n[Bea] Big time. I am big time okay. I just had to pee for like the last six hours and I just started this new internship. And I didn’t want to ask anyone where the bathroom was because I didn’t want them to think I was weak and not a problem solver.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. Every human does it. It’s very, very normal.\\nYeah.\\nPeppermint tea, two sugars.\\n[Bea] Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Hi.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nOh, hey. You…\\n[Bea] So are you going to ask me out now?\\nYeah. Yeah, I am. I’m Ben.\\n[Bea] I’m Bea.\\n[Bea] So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, you would not be able to protect us?\\nNo, no. You’d be dead.\\n[Bea] You would let me die?\\nI’m not going to let you die. I’m just going to survive. You’re right. You’re right. You’re right.\\n[Bea] I was a gymnast.\\nGymnast?\\n[Bea] Yes. For like five years. I got like sixth place on beam.\\n\\n\\n\\nSixth place?\\n[Bea] Yes. Got a ribbon.\\nI’m impressed.\\n[Bea] Everybody gets a ribbon.\\nAll right, wait to cool down. You just saw me take it off the burning stove.\\n[Bea] Oh, my God.\\nIf you’re going to be a lawyer, you got to understand negligence and breach and McDonald’s versus that lady’s habeas corpus.\\n[Bea] You used none of those terms properly.\\nHow do you know? You’re not a lawyer yet. It’s not too late to choose a more noble profession.\\n[Bea] Oh, like you?\\nYou’re right. Stick with it. I’m going to need a lawyer at some point.\\n[Bea] I don’t even know if I want to be a lawyer. I cannot believe I just said that out loud. I’m sorry. My life is a disaster right now.\\nMight be turning the corner. You just met me.\\n[Bea] Or I might end up in a suitcase. I mean, look at this place. It looks like every serial killer reenactment documentary. Why do you have a giant wrench?\\nOkay, it wouldn’t be a suitcase. It’d be a carry-on because you’re zero feet tall. And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how broken something is, there’s always a way to fix it. I’m sorry. I don’t know why I’m talking to you about my mom right now.\\n[Bea] Alright. Then tell me about that.\\nThat is a long story. Everybody survived.\\n[Bea] Great.\\n[Bea] Holly, I don’t know this guy. He’s fucking great.\\nYo, let’s go, Benny. Come on, cupcake. We’re gonna be late.\\n‘Sup, Pete.\\nNo way. You cooked? That girl you blew me off for stayed over?\\n[Bea] He asked me out and then I kind of asked him out and then we just walked around the city and we fell asleep talking. I don’t– I left before you could wake up. I don’t know why. Why did I? What the fuck am I doing? Okay, I love you. Bye. I’m so sorry I woke you up. I didn’t– This whole thing is so new to me. Bye.\\nYou got cheese and bread. You didn’t miss one ingredient. What you doing with that? Why you got the giant wrench? You told her about your mom, bro? You don’t tell nobody about your mom. Fuck, dog. You in love, man. About fucking time, man. My boy’s in love.\\nFuck that. I couldn’t get her out of here fast enough. This girl’s a disaster. She’s a nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIX MONTHS LATER\\nWant to get a mansion, a jacuzzi, a theater to watch my movies, a couple whips and lots of fancy things.\\nThe kids, they call the goonies.\\nI see the future crystal ball, mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall.\\nGot your girlfriend screaming all the cops.\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nClaudia.\\nHolly.\\nThere we go.\\nHey, what’s up, Glee?\\nBen, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.\\nAre we saying that now?\\nYeah, is that cool?\\nYeah, I mean, I don’t really like labels, but I like you a whole bunch. I like your friend a whole bunch. And if she wants to put a label on me, then she can sew it on wherever she wants. That was weird. That was weird. I’m not into S&M or anything like that, unless you are, which would be totally cool, you know? You do you.\\nWell, she really likes you, too. And that is very rare for her.\\nOh, look who’s talking.\\nHow’s the crowd in here tonight?\\nOver there, big boy.\\nOh, B.\\nDo ladies like dumplings? We just had the greatest dumplings.\\nPete, meet my sister. This is Pete, Claudia’s brother.\\n[Bea] Nice to meet you.\\nAnd Ben. Ben. This is Ben. We all grew up together.\\nHey.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nYou two know each other?\\nYeah, we met.\\n[Bea] Barely.\\nWow, that’s so random.\\n[Bea] I’m going to go grab a drink.\\nDoor’s that way if you’re looking to sneak out. I know that’s your thing.\\n[Bea] Well, I am a disaster.\\nLet’s go away from this.\\nYeah.\\nSo you a lawyer yet?\\n[Bea] Why? Do you need a defense attorney?\\nI’m just curious how you passed the class on ethics and not bailing on people.\\nI think that’s the jerk who B got with when she was on her break from Jonathan.\\nNo way. So B’s the coffee girl who ghosted him?\\nI thought she looked familiar, but I don’t see faces. I just see souls.\\nAt least he made her realize that Jonathan was the one.\\n[Bea] I’m engaged now.\\nGood for you. Where are you registered? I’ll buy you a broomstick.\\n[Bea] I’ll send you an invite. You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?\\nYou do remember. See, it did mean something to you.\\n[Bea] You’ll always be my rock bottom. The night I spent with a bitch.\\nDid she just call him a bitch?\\nYou think they’re going to physically fight?\\nOr fuck?\\nThat’s a fine line.\\n[Bea] Let’s just get through tonight for them, OK?\\nElle, she’s your sister. I’m sure the relationship won’t last long.\\n[Bea] She’s your friend. I question why they’re even together.\\nThen I’m going to get a drink and toast to never seeing you again.\\n[Bea] Cheers to that, bro.\\n\\nANYONE BUT YOU\\nSo before I pronounce this newlywed couple, if anyone has an issue with these two wonderful people joining together in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.\\nI have an objection.\\nLeo, don’t do this.\\nI have to, Annie. It’s just not right. There’s no way I can bless this union without their friends and family joining us to celebrate in Australia.\\nWe’re getting married in Sydney.\\n\\nWelcome on board. 2K to the front.\\nThank you, Sheryl.\\n51E, how long’s the flight?\\n16 hours. 51F, thanks. 73F, all the way to the back.\\nHey. Head of the wedding?\\n[Bea] Of my sister, yes, I am.\\nHow crazy is it that we’re on the same plane?\\n[Bea] Don’t think there’s thousands of flights flying to Sydney every day.\\nOh, there’s quite a few, actually. Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, some co-chairs. Serendipity, I guess.\\n[Bea] I don’t think that word means what you think it means.\\nSo where’s your fiance? Wait, is this him? Hey, I’m Ben. I was her hall pass on your break.\\nWhat?\\nOh my god, I forgot. Claude told me you dumped him. Did you sneak out on your wedding day?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Wow, you are a child.\\nIt’s a pretty long flight. Do you want anything from the front of the boat? Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?\\n[Bea] No, thank you. I’m all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.\\nNothing small about me.\\nWhat the fuck?\\nHave a good flight. See you there.\\n\\nWhy do so many of us feel stuck? How is it even a very successful? Often feel like there is something missing from their lives. Why do so many people spend years mystically thinking about choices they might have made? One answer to that problem, many of us are leading lives that are misaligned with our own deepest values and preferences.\\nThank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain. What psychology can teach us about living our most authentic lives?\\n[Bea] What the fuck?\\n\\nHey, Vinny! Vindale! OK, Vin, looking good.\\nThanks for picking me up, dude.\\nNot just you, my guy.\\nSpelling Bee!\\n[Bea] Hey!\\nOur sisters are getting married. How dope is that?\\n[Bea] I know, I’m so excited.\\nOh, great. All right, let’s hit it.\\nThank you. I hope all of you have a wonderful vacation. I wish you all the best for the Mid-Autumn Festival.\\nBye.\\nY’all ready for Australia?\\nCan’t wait for y’all to see where we stay. And the plan is so dope.\\nWe’re all staying at the same place?\\nYep, my stepdad’s house. Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.\\n[Bea] Sounds like a piece of information that could have been shared a little earlier.\\nWell, that’s because they think you guys hate each other, so they didn’t want to poke the beard.\\n\\nNot bad, right?\\nYou don’t even play tennis.\\nI know, but I feel sweet.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee, y’all.\\nMeet Kalonabee.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee.\\nAll over.\\nAll over.\\nSpin, spin, spin.\\nWoo-hoo!\\nHe was the only member of the family who was trans.\\nYeah, he was there.\\n[Bea] Whoa.\\nYou’re right. This place is insane.\\nI know. All right, let’s get some sand under your feet.\\nHave you guys made up?\\nAll good.\\n[Bea] We’re fine if he just stays away from me.\\nDon’t need an invitation for that.\\n[Bea] I think you do if you’re like this. You can’t leave me alone.\\nSame reason I slowed down at the car crash.\\nOkay, so you guys buried the hatchet, water under the bridge, two adults adulting like fucking adults.\\nOh, we did have a little bit of a last minute snafu though. You guys are gonna have to share a room. There’s only one bed, but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.\\nShe’s kidding.\\n[Bea] You’re funny. I can’t wait any longer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWait for me!\\nHallie’s such a goof.\\nShe’s good for you. She could use some spontaneity.\\nHey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.\\nI hope so. I have a million contingencies and scenarios for everything. And honestly, I just want this wedding to be beautiful because I love the shit out of her and I just wanna marry the bitch, you know what I’m saying?\\nYou’re such a romantic.\\nHey, don’t be mad at me, but Margaret’s here.\\nWhy would I be mad? She lives here, I was 100% expecting to see her.\\nYeah. Margaret, Margaret, look who’s here.\\nThere she is. 100%.\\nGo rip off the band-aid.\\nBabe!\\nHow’s it going, stranger?\\nI was hoping you’d come. I wanted to message you, but I didn’t know how you’d feel about hearing from me.\\nAre you kidding?\\n[Bea] I’m never leaving.\\nNever leave.\\n[Bea] How are mom and dad?\\nThey’re good. You know, mom now thinks she’s Australian and dad’s not at all pointing out every tiny little detail that’s different. They’re also a little worried how you’re gonna react to all this.\\n[Bea] What are you talking about?\\nWell, you know, everybody thought that you’d be the one getting married first. You always used to talk about your wedding growing up. You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress when I just used it to dress like a mummy, you know?\\n[Bea] Hallie, stop. That’s not me anymore. I’m free now. I’m deprogrammed. That does not mean I don’t support you and your misguided view that soulmates exist.\\nThat’s sweet. Is that gonna be your toast?\\n[Bea] You and Claudia are the exception. I’m really happy for you, for real. What’s going on over there?\\nThat’s Claudia’s cousin. She visited the States a few years back. They dated. No biggie. Broke up with him. Crushed his heart.\\nNo way, that man does not have a heart.\\nFeels like forever ago. We were babies.\\nI’m really happy you’re here. We can reconnect as maybe not babies.\\nI would love that. Beau! Come eat my mate. Ben, this is my partner, Beau.\\nHi, mate.\\nLike, tennis partner?\\nSometimes after. How do you two dags know each other?\\nWe had a bit of a go back when, didn’t we?\\nDid you now? Good on ya. Hey, we’re gonna go trotting this weekend. Hit up the turps out here, eh? It’s gonna be a cracker. Woo!\\nYou know it.\\nGreat guy.\\nYeah.\\n\\nMommy!\\nHey, Beatrice.\\n[Bea] Dad!\\nYou made it.\\nOh, baby.\\nHi, baby.\\nHi, honey.\\nOh, my God.\\nWow.\\nHow’s our future lawyer?\\n[Bea] Great.\\nGreat.\\n[Bea] How’s the trip been?\\nOh, magical. The Australians are all wonderful. And excuse me, but good looking.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nWhy are they so weird about their plugs? I mean, this place is basically America. They speak English, they eat regular food, they have a complicated relationship with their past.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI’m doing okay.\\n[Bea] I’m doing great. My big sister’s getting married.\\nCould have been you. Could still be you someday.\\nHave you heard from Jonathan? Did he call or anything?\\nWell, that didn’t take long.\\nWe’re just torn up that he’s not part of our family anymore.\\nI mean, he works at our house every night from like 11 years old. He was basically family. Was about to be actual family.\\n[Bea] If I never ask you for anything ever again, can you please just lay off of me this weekend?\\nI just want both of our daughters to be happy.\\n[Bea] I’m very happy, but not when you guys do this.\\nNed, you in the right direction? He’s such a great guy. Just think on it, yeah?\\n\\nBee, dinner at 7.30, okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Yeah.\\nBen, all set for dinner, yeah?\\nYeah, I’ll be there.\\n\\nI was plagiarizing.\\nHey!\\nHi Ben!\\nHey Ben!\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nEverybody?\\nDad’s speech.\\nOh yes, right, okay. We’re gonna make this short, because you’ve all traveled a bloody long distance, and Carol and I are so appreciative. Biggest thing we’ve missed since coming back from the States is not seeing our kids. And you lot, our extended family, so we’re just over the moon to have a full house before the wedding on Sunday.\\nWhere we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia, setting off on this crazy thing called life. And of course, Innie and Leo, our new family.\\nWell, we’re just so grateful, not only for your incredible hospitality, but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.\\nSo as they say in our country, abondanza.\\nCheers!\\nNow baby.\\nWow!\\nWhat classes are you loving? Have you given any more thought to tort law? ‘Cause class action is really where it’s at right now. What does Jonathan say? He knows you pretty well. What does he think you should do?\\n[Bea] Mom.\\nOkay.\\nI can’t even remember why we put you in the truck again. We didn’t put her in the trunk, she stowed away in the trunk.\\nYeah, I wanted to go with you guys to see Cinderella.\\nWe were going to Coachella.\\nI know that now, it was nice.\\nAll right, everyone. So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy. Let’s just have a moment to calm ourselves. I am not looking at anybody in particular, but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.\\nCrown chakra.\\nLet’s hit that cobra.\\nCleanse, get that weasel.\\nOkay.\\nGo!\\nYou go, you go.\\nSign of the times.\\nAll right, all right, four words.\\nFirst word, the, A, of, if.\\nAnimosity, hate, liar.\\nFive words.\\n[Bea] No, just shut the fuck up.\\nThe Bible.\\nA woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality to take advantage of other people.\\nMom, focus, okay? Right here, right here.\\nThis is a white people’s game. Y’all spend so much time trying to trick each other. Y’all got so much time on your hands. Just say the word.\\nIt’s on the extreme.\\nGrumpy old man.\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nOkay, okay, yeah, okay.\\n[Bea] Fuck boy.\\nOld cat woman.\\n[Bea] Your ego.\\nOkay.\\nWhat is this?\\n[Bea] Wait, no props.\\nNo one cares, no one can see us.\\n[Bea] Cheaters are shocking.\\nSays the woman who cheated on her fiance.\\n[Bea] We were on a break, asshole.\\nYou’re either broken up for good, or you’re cheating. Either way, someone’s lying to someone.\\n[Bea] I must have really gotten under your skin.\\nRoger, what is this?\\nFat, five.\\nWhat is the thing I’m holding in my hand?\\nFireworks.\\nFireworks by Katy Perry.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] That is not fair.\\nHey, what, you’re not fair. What’s wrong with you? Just stop.\\n[Bea] What are you doing?\\nWhat is wrong with you?\\n[Bea] Stop.\\nOh God.\\nOh God.\\nSam, what the?\\nOh my God.\\nAli.\\nGet back.\\nSam.\\nRoger.\\nI’ve got this.\\nThat’s some gangster shit right there.\\nSorry.\\n[Bea] Sorry.\\n\\nThey’re going to ruin our wedding.\\nAll that matters is that we’re together.\\nIt’s true.\\nLook baby, I love you to the moon and back, but those two fuckwads are going to destroy our weekend, and our memories, which we are going to have for a very long time, are headed straight over a cliff.\\nIt’s going to be fine baby, we just have to. to stand there and profess our love.\\nIt seems to me, their animus only surfaced after they spent a night together. Am I accurate?\\nThat’s usually how it goes, honey.\\nWe crumple our feelings into a ball and shove ’em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.\\nThe solution appears to be simple then. We return them to the night they were spent.\\nLike we trick them into falling in love with each other?\\nHe didn’t say anything about love, honey. We just need to get them to jump each other’s bones.\\n\\nYeah, come on!\\nThat was good, right?\\nThat was good.\\nYou go, you go, you go, you go, you go.\\nShe clearly has eyes for Ben.\\nWho does, father?\\nHallie Spence, the sister. The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.\\nYou can’t say that. What the hell?\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that was rude. I apologize to anyone that was listening, which can only be you, Pete, ’cause you’re the only person that was listening. I apologize.\\nI accept your apology and will now move on. Do you know Bea’s been in love with Ben since the first night they met?\\nWell, why didn’t she tell him? You know, when I was a young bloke and I liked a girl, I would sneak up behind her and I’d cut a lock of her hair and then I’d smack her on the bum!\\nWhat the hell?\\nI don’t know, I’m not good at this, sorry.\\nBea was just too scared to tell him, but I’ve talked to her and she says she regrets walking out that morning.\\nTell me more, son.\\nWhy me?\\nBecause you’re really good at it, right? You can do it.\\nWhy me, why? Why you put this hat on me? No one can see me, it’s a radio play, motherfucker. Bea wants us to tell him how much she likes him, so he lets his guard down and goes to her. Some Cupid’s killed with arrows and some with traps.\\nThat was good, I like that, that’s good.\\nI just made it up.\\nSo, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers, and say, “Come to Papa.”\\nWhat are you doing?\\nI’m from a different generation.\\nAnd your generation sucks. You fucked up the whole world for us.\\nAnd I’m full of shame. But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.\\nBut Ben feels awful that he called her a disaster. I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.\\nThen why is he fighting with her?\\nWell, because he likes her.\\nAnd I know that Bea likes Ben. She’s just denying herself because she’s got in her head somehow that she’ll never love again.\\nWhoa, I’m not talking about love, baby. I’m talking about dick.\\nOh, it’s Ben.\\nOh.\\nHey. You.\\n[Bea] Oh God, they got to you too?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia say how much I like you?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really?\\nIt was Pete and Roger.\\n[Bea] Fantastic, it’s a team effort. They’re trying to get us together.\\nNo way.\\n[Bea] Come here.\\nOh, maybe they want us to stop acting like assholes so we don’t ruin the biggest event of their lives.\\n[Bea] Us? There is no us and assholes. You’re the one who destroyed the living room.\\nWould you two mind helping me with something? I hate to ask, but I’d really appreciate it.\\nSure.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\n\\nSo Roger left his sunglasses on the sailboat. I swear, if his head wasn’t screwed on, we’d use it as a bowling ball. Do me a favor and swim out and get them. It’s the one on the right.\\nBoth of us.\\n[Bea] Is that really a two person job?\\nDoesn’t seem like it.\\nYou two. Yeah.\\n[Bea] All right, so everyone’s involved in this.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] I feel bad.\\nMe too.\\n[Bea] I don’t want to bum Holly and Claudia out.\\nJust me and you.\\n[Bea] Can you not swim?\\nI’m an excellent swimmer.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of breath?\\nI’m fine. How much further do you think?\\n[Bea] Are your eyes closed?\\nI think it’s dark.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of shape? You have like a 10 pop.\\nI’m not out of shape. I’ve been to 295, 300 once. I just don’t do cardio.\\n[Bea] Oh my God, you’re hot girl fit.\\nI’m not hot girl fit.\\n[Bea] Okay, my bad. We’ll see you at the boat.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nI could have done it myself, but whatever. Thanks.\\n[Bea] No fucking way.\\nHoney, look who’s here.\\n[Bea] I cannot believe they did this.\\nWho is that?\\n[Bea] That is my ex, Jonathan.\\nHey, hey.\\nWhat is he doing here?\\n[Bea] My Black Hawk helicopter parents have been trying to get us back together for the past four months.\\nThey flew him halfway across the world to your sister’s wedding? That’s some deep off shit. They came to play.\\n[Bea] That’s my parents. They think I’m throwing my life away.\\nHoney, we’re just gonna take him back and get him all settled in.\\nI’ll see you later.\\n[Bea] You know, maybe we should do it. Just tell everyone we’re together.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] It would solve that problem for me and that problem for you.\\nI don’t have a problem.\\n[Bea] You clearly want Margaret.\\nNo, I don’t.\\n[Bea] Yes, you do. I saw the way you looked at her last night and I know she broke your heart. She sees you’re with me. She wants what she can’t have and then bye bye crocodile Jack. Fuck, he’s fast.\\nMaking her jealous is not gonna work. We’re not in seventh grade.\\n[Bea] Trust me, bro. We’re all in seventh grade when it comes to this stuff. They’ve already gone through all of the bullshit trying to trick us into each other’s arms. Let’s just embrace it.\\nThere’s no way we can convince anyone we actually like each other.\\n[Bea] Yeah, you’re right.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] You know, I still think about that night we spent together.\\nShut up.\\n[Bea] No, I’m serious. You know, this could be kind of fun. We’re at a wedding a million miles away from home. Who knows what could happen under the cover of a masquerade. And that night at your place, no matter how it ended, it was still pretty amazing. … Convincing enough?\\nFuck it. Let’s do it. … Just wait. Wait.\\nOkay, okay. Whoever wants to go on the hike, we need to leave now. We’re running behind schedule.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nBabe, the mountains have been there for millions of years. A few more minutes isn’t gonna hurt them.\\nBaby, I know you are trying to calm me down and I love you for it. Thank you. But I am hurting cats right now and I need some help instead of this easy breezy Martin Scorsese.\\nAw, jitters. Remember our wedding?\\nOnly that you’re the most beautiful bride on God’s green earth.\\nRight answer.\\nWe’re coming, we’re coming, we’re coming.\\nJinx, you owe me a cup.\\nOh, you have a little something in your teeth.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.\\nYeah, let me just take that out.\\nOh, I gotta get it out.\\nOh, it’s right there.\\nGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.\\nHoney, here he is.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] Jonathan.\\nSo nice to see you.\\n[Bea] I had no idea you were coming.\\nSo your parents didn’t tell you, okay? Yeah, you know, the first thing I asked them when they invited me was, “Does B know?” ‘Cause otherwise this would be really fucking awkward. And now it is fucking awkward.\\nNo, no, not at all.\\nI’m in a lot of love.\\nNo, you’re like family. It’d be effing awkward if you weren’t here.\\nI’m so glad you’re here.\\nI’m so happy for you two. Hey, congratulations.\\nYeah, thanks.\\nRight?\\n[Bea] It’s great to see you.\\nIt’s great to see you too.\\nWe’re all going on a hike, so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out. Let’s move out.\\n[Bea] Ben, meet Jonathan.\\nOh, hey, man.\\nI’m Ben.\\nHey, oh, Pete and Claudia’s friend, right?\\nAlso friends with Bea, among other things.\\nYeah, it’s nice to meet you.\\nOkay, plenty of enough time in the car to do whatever the fuck this is. Come on, let’s go!\\nYeah, okay. Yeah.\\n[Bea] We need to come up with a game plan.\\nYeah, you are so terrible at this.\\n[Bea] What?\\nWe’re doing this thing!\\nHoney, I’m sorry. I know we should have asked you, but we had to invite you.\\nOh, it’s totally fine. I’m glad he’s here. I love him and Holly loves him.\\nReally?\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nGreat, okay. So we’re spending a little time together away from the real world and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, Mom, guys, no. I totally forgot to tell you, but I’m with Ben. … Do you want to come?\\nI think I’m going to hang back and yell at your parents. Have fun.\\n\\nAlright, so is it like we just got together or we’ve been sneaking around? Oh, I got it. What if we ran into each other at Chipotle, lady in the tramp, the burrito?\\n[Bea] No.\\nThis can’t be that hard.\\n[Bea] It’s harder than you think. My parents don’t even believe it yet.\\nYou told them five seconds ago.\\n[Bea] They know I would never go out with a guy like you.\\nYou’ve been with one guy your entire life.\\n[Bea] Jonathan’s a better man than you’ll ever be.\\nAnd yet you left him. Which is why exactly? Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.\\n[Bea] Okay, you don’t know my boxes and you never will. Just figure this out, please.\\nOkay. We just suck face in front of everybody. Half of them think they set us up anyway.\\n[Bea] No, that’s too much. We need to do something that’s more hidden so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.\\nYou’re calling me a fuckboy like it’s an insult? I own that shit.\\n[Bea] Let’s just be affectionate. I know it’s a foreign concept for you.\\nI can be affectionate. I’ll affectionate the shit out of you.\\nI can’t believe your parents invited Jonathan. Now I have to find a table to sit him at.\\nWhat about Bea?\\nNo, no, she’s fine. She’s sitting with us at our table.\\nNo, I’m talking about how she’s already at a low point because she’s going through a breakup and I don’t even know what’s happening with school. She never even talks about it anymore.\\nI guess I could put up with the cousins.\\nWhy?\\nYou alright?\\nOh, shit.\\nWow.\\nCheck it out, guys!\\nNice!\\nYeah!\\nBeautiful!\\nSee, I told you it was going to be good.\\nMan, that’s nice.\\n[Bea] Oh, wow.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] So beautiful.\\nThere it is.\\nFeel the serenity.\\nPretty spectacular, hey?\\nIt’s amazing.\\n[Bea] Alright, your turn.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] This is just so romantic.\\nOkay, nuzzle my neck.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nGet in there. Damn, you are short.\\n[Bea] You are not tall enough to say that.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Oh, are you ticklish?\\nNo, I’m acting.\\n[Bea] Like a toddler?\\nNo, go away. Okay, I can use that.\\n[Bea] Beg me. Beg me to stuff you in the butt.\\nStop! Just let me do it. Permission to put my left hand on your right buttock.\\n[Bea] Granted. Too hard.\\nSorry. You gotta sell it.\\n[Bea] Okay, not in circles. It’s not a magic lamp.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Okay, now you’re just playing bop it.\\nI’ve never rubbed a bopper show.\\n[Bea] Clearly, you’ve tried. Are you not wearing underwear?\\nIt’s a swimsuit. I’m on holiday.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nOkay, just mind the gap.\\n[Bea] How’s that?\\nThat’s good. Just like, but you don’t have to hover. Just kind of, oh, man the woods.\\n[Bea] I’m sorry.\\nOkay, just take it out.\\n[Bea] You try.\\nYou want me to stick my finger in my own ass? How’s that gonna convince? Oh, on you. I can’t. Jesus Christ, it’s like a vacuum pack down here. How’d you get in this thing? Oh, man, it’s tight. Oh, see, it’s like holding a baby bird.\\n[Bea] God damn it.\\nWere they not watching this whole time?\\n[Bea] You like a mole or something on your butt?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really? ‘Cause I feel something.\\nI don’t have a mole. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Are there any more on me?\\n[Bea] I don’t know.\\nJack, spiders hunt bears. They hunt bears.\\nNo pictures. Put the cameras down. We’re not gonna take a spirit.\\nAre there any more?\\n[Bea] I don’t know.\\nWhere are they? I feel it. I feel it.\\n[Bea] I think I see something.\\nWhat do you see? What do you see?\\n[Bea] Oh, no, that’s just a part of you. You’re fine.\\nAll right, look, if I have one of those little fuckers in me, they might be in you.\\n[Bea] I’m good.\\nThat’s probably a better way to check than what I did.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nAll right, little one, we join your journey. We do not inherit the earth. We just borrow it from our creatures.\\nHey, guys. What did we miss?\\nWow.\\n\\nWhy can’t I get this?\\nBecause you’re meant to learn to dive when you’re six.\\nYou got this, hon.\\nYou ever try focusing on your toes? My mom taught me this trick. If you pretend like there’s a string from your nose to your toes, you just kind of maintain that position. You mind doing it again? This time I’m going to shout out a tribute question. I think it’s just going to help clear your mind.\\nJust make sure it’s a question about airplanes or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\\nOkay, um, uh, what company created the Concorde?\\nA collaboration between British Airways and the French government. How’d I do?\\nYou’re good there.\\nMaybe your mom can teach him how to dive.\\nShe passed away.\\nOh, I’m so sorry.\\nYeah, sorry.\\nAll right, I’m going to go again, but this time give me one with a little shorter answer.\\nI have a better idea. You just let me do everything, I’ll guide you in. Don’t think.\\nBe careful of his shoulder.\\nYeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.\\nWouldn’t let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.\\nI had to tell her I love her. When you know she’s the one, nothing else matters.\\nI’m waving, thank you, thank you.\\nThere you go.\\nDid I do it?\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Good job, babe.\\nYour dad’s a natural.\\n[Bea] I’m so glad you guys got to spend some time with Ben.\\nAre you two really…\\n…getting to know each other in a very respectful manner? One befitting such a kind and intelligent woman as your daughter.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are in the early stages.\\nNot too early.\\n[Bea] But also not so advanced.\\nJust that magical moment when two people come together in this crazy journey we call life.\\n[Bea] That’s why I was so worried when Jonathan showed up. I don’t want to hurt his feelings.\\nI even suggested we hide our light under a bushel for his sake.\\n[Bea] But our love is just so strong. And I know what you guys are thinking. He’s much older.\\nThey weren’t, right? Probably thinking I’m 27, early 28s.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are very happy.\\nHappiest.\\n[Bea] Yep.\\nYou know, you looked like that back in the day.\\nNo, I didn’t. That guy’s made out of cobblestone.\\nThey’re holding hands.\\nI think it’s working.\\nI can’t believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.\\n[Bea] Was that bullshit about your mom?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] The story about the giant wrench. I thought it might have been a lie until all your one night nothings.\\nYou ever heard that too?\\n[Bea] Like, I didn’t mean… I’m sorry. And it wasn’t a lie.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so nice to my dad. You should probably rinse off. You have his SPF a billion on you now.\\nCheers, mate. I’ll just grab a quickie.\\nOkay.\\nSo, Australia. What do you reckon, eh? How you finding it?\\nI don’t know. It’s great.\\nMaz goes on about you all the time. Ripper Cunt, she calls you.\\nMaz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is…\\nGood friend. Oh, yeah. You know you had a proper surf when sand gets all up your clacker. And your gobbler, too.\\nGobbler is…\\nYou know, your hog bonnet. You know, your beef cap. Come on, mate. You know, the anteater. Anyway, good to have ya. Gotcha.\\nG’day, love.\\nHey, mate. Fancy a game?\\n[Bea] You’re going down. How have you been doing?\\nPretty good. You?\\n[Bea] Okay, I guess.\\nHow’s school going? Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?\\n[Bea] You know me. I’ve never been one for practicing.\\nStill having second thoughts?\\n[Bea] Straight to third.\\nI know it’s weird, me being here, but believe me, I had nothing to do with it. Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.\\n[Bea] That’s sweet. You’re part of the family.\\nI’d be lying if I said I haven’t been thinking about you.\\n[Bea] Yeah, me too.\\nHow long have you and that guy, Ben, been?\\n[Bea] It’s kind of new. Not like new, new, but newish.\\nWell, I think he seems great.\\n[Bea] No, you don’t.\\nI really don’t.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so cool about all of this. Not just this, but this too.\\nIt’s really good to see you, Bea.\\n[Bea] I’m glad you’re here. Now let’s have fun.\\nLet’s do it.\\nMate.\\nThat’s me.\\nYou want a coffee? It’s the best in the world.\\nYou guys are really proud of your coffee here.\\nIt’s the best in the fucking world.\\nOkay.\\nEnjoy.\\nFuck, that is good.\\nI was thinking of going for a bit of a run later. Do you want to join?\\nI’m actually going on a bike ride with Bea, so I don’t think I can.\\nShe’s a little sweet on you, hey?\\nOh, you caught that.\\nHow long have you and Beau been together?\\nNah, we’re just banging about. He’s nice, but I think I’m looking for someone less casual. More romantic.\\nWow.\\nWhy did me and you ever break up anyway?\\nI don’t really remember, but I think you said something like I was an immature, drongo, smothered in ex body spray.\\nSmells like you’re not that guy anymore. Bea’s a lucky girl.\\nOh.\\nHey, open the door. Bea.\\n[Bea] What’s wrong?\\nMargaret thinks we’re together.\\n[Bea] That’s great.\\nNo, Margaret needs to think we’re the right type of together. Not together together, but like situationally together. ‘Cause if she thinks we’re together together, she’s not gonna break girl code. So we need to finesse our togetherness so that we’re together, but there’s an opening for our togetherness and she can just slide right in so that we can be together.\\n[Bea] Are you on Coke?\\nNo, it’s like coffee here. It’s like meth. I’m guessing. No, I’m not. I worked at Goldman. Partner’s wedding. Do what you do.\\n[Bea] Jesus, dude, who are you?\\nI’m a man trying to figure this out. Look at your room, it’s so much bigger. You got a painting? Wow, that’s so red. We have to kick it up a notch. Make it feel like we’re in the Gaga stage.\\n[Bea] What do you wanna do, take me in the hallway?\\nThat is not Gaga. Actually, that could be construed as Gaga. Tonight’s the rehearsal dinner, so we have to do something that makes it look like you’re into me, but you’re not into me. And I’m into you, but you can tell by my face that it’s never gonna mount.\\n[Bea] Get it together, man.\\nYou hit me so much.\\n\\nOkay, Kalana, now pretend this is a real fox that messed up our garden. Fuck it up. Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up. Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up. Fuck it up. Ooh. You see that?\\nHe did it, yeah. Oh, hey, they’re here. All right, everybody, wheels up.\\nHustle up.\\nBad dog.\\nYou look cute.\\nBaby, you look so good.\\nShe’s has been.\\nYou look so good.\\nYeah, I look bad.\\nMan, this is the best time to say that.\\nDaddy’s a dad.\\nCome on, let’s go.\\nYeah.\\nAll right, let’s do it.\\nThank you.\\nYou see the size of that boat?\\nHey, guys.\\nWoo!\\n[Bea] Nice touch.\\nNice dress.\\nYou have a good heart.\\nI love this dress.\\nYou look fine.\\nOh, thank you.\\nWhat would you like to drink?\\nWhat’s a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?\\nThree scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.\\nOh, thank you.\\nAll right.\\nYou remembered.\\nThat you can’t handle hard liquor? Yeah, the smell’s still not out of my car.\\nYou know I feel really bad about that. That was a fun night. That was a fun summer.\\nMarks! Marks, captain says that we can steer the ship.\\nOh, okay, I’m coming. Hang on, I’ve got heels on.\\nLook how lucky we are. On a boat sailing back and forth with no real transportation or reason.\\nOkay.\\nAnd look at you, Polly Pocket. You the belle of the boat.\\nHe didn’t remember me.\\nOh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?\\nNo, honey, that’s, yes, I think it might be. Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.\\nThere it is.\\nWell, at least that was subtle.\\n[Bea] Was it?\\nThis oddly reminds me of prom.\\n[Bea] The first or second time?\\nJonathan is just the most perfect guy.\\nHe’s like a son to us.\\nWell, that might be a problem, mate. They might not wanna shag a brother.\\nSo how’s it going? Can parents back off a little?\\n[Bea] How about you?\\nGame on.\\n[Bea] Can you even dance?\\nYou just let me lead.\\n[Bea] Oh, God.\\nLet’s go.\\nIs Margaret watching?\\nIt’s a little hard to tell what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.\\nEverybody to the top deck, we about to do a champagne toast.\\n[Bea] Come with me.\\nSo what are we doing?\\n[Bea] Closing the deal. Titanic me.\\nWhat?\\nOh, help yourself to some champagne.\\nOh, thank you.\\nGrab some drinks.\\nOh, great.\\nNice.\\n[Bea] Titanic me.\\nNo, that is so lame.\\n[Bea] Exactly. The only people who would do something this lame are the ones who know how lame it is, but are in the first stages of liking each other, so they’re totally comfortable in their mutual lameness. Toast me.\\nOh my God.\\n[Bea] Come on.\\nThis is so cringe. So is saying cringe, old man.\\n[Bea] Lift my arms.\\nI’ve seen the movie.\\n[Bea] Have you?\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nThis is never gonna work.\\nAww! That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!\\nAre they doing Titanic?\\nAww!\\n[Bea] Are they watching?\\nYep.\\n[Bea] Are they buying it?\\nCan’t imagine they would.\\nIt’s real. We did it.\\nWe’re good. We’re really bloody good.\\nJonathan, have you seen Tasmania?\\nInya, I’m fine. It’s fine.\\nCan I do the line? That’s king of the world. You’re king of the world.\\n[Bea] Jack, I’m flying!\\nOkay, we can stop there.\\nWe can stop there.\\nThey’re gone. Show’s over.\\nOh my god!\\n[Bea] No! Wait for me! Help! Wait! Wait!\\nBae! Bea! Are you okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Why’d you jump in?\\nTo save you!\\n[Bea] But you’re a terrible swimmer!\\nI’m a great swimmer! Just short distances.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna die.\\nWe’re not gonna die.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna get hypothermia.\\nThe water’s 90 degrees.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna get eaten by sharks. Fuck! We’re gonna get eaten by sharks!\\nWe are gonna be fine. And we spent ten hours shredding water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.\\n[Bea] Goldman?\\nYeah, it was a partner’s kids bar mitzvah. A little bit of crack.\\nOh my god!\\nRoger!\\nOh my god!\\nIt looks like they’re going full Titanic. I love the commitment!\\nStop the boat!\\nNo, no, no.\\nHelp!\\nThey’re coming!\\nStay calm!\\nThis is not a very good swim.\\nBei!\\nThere.\\n[Bea] Are you sure?\\nYeah. Come on.\\nWhy aren’t we turning the boat around?\\nWe are in too shallow of water. We’ll run aground.\\nBut harbour rescue has been notified.\\nCome on.\\nAre you good?\\n[Bea] Mm-hmm.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] All right. Okay.\\nLet’s go.\\n[Bea] All right, get in the row.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] That was, um, probably the most– I mean, if you didn’t close it with Margaret, I don’t– There’s nothing more romantic than jumping in to save me.\\nYeah, well, Jonathan didn’t do it, that’s for sure. Your parents half the clock, that’s shit.\\n[Bea] You didn’t even give him a chance.\\nWhy do you keep defending this guy? Why do you break up with him in the first place?\\n[Bea] It’s complicated.\\nIt’s never complicated. What, he cheated on you? Drug problem? Did you catch him measuring his dick with a ruler app?\\n[Bea] We never fought.\\nIsn’t that a good thing?\\n[Bea] It was just comfortable. And he’s a great guy, which means there’s no one out there for me because I had the best one. I couldn’t even tell him I quit law school. And I have no idea what I’m gonna do with my life. We’re gonna get eaten by sharks, I had to tell somebody.\\nNo one else knows?\\n[Bea] I don’t think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.\\nYou finally did it.\\n[Bea] What?\\nYou know, one night you said you didn’t want to be a lawyer anyways.\\n[Bea] You remember that?\\nIt was a memorable night, until you snuck out, of course. Why did you?\\n[Bea] Because you scared the shit out of me. It was the first time in my life that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.\\nI know a little bit about that. I was really hurt when you left. So I said all that terrible stuff about you to Pete. That’s not how I felt.\\n[Bea] Look at us. Just a couple of fucked up people floating in the middle of the harbor. Promise me if we make it out alive we’ll go see that from dry land.\\nIt’s a pretty killer view from here.\\n[Bea] It’s dumb but I want to see the people. Landmarks like those are full of people in love. Marriage proposals, honeymooners, romantics jumping off of moving trains just to see the building with the person they love.\\nLike your dad in the Eiffel Tower?\\n[Bea] He told you that?\\nNothing else matters when it comes to love.\\n[Bea] You could use a bit of that right now.\\nIt’s not dumb. You, me and the opera house. It’s a date. I promise.\\n[Bea] What’s wrong?\\nI’m a little afraid of flying.\\n[Bea] Don’t you fly all the time for your job?\\nI have a very specific routine. I mask, headphones, build my bubble.\\nThat’s my Serenity song. How do you know my Serenity song?\\n[Bea] Don’t worry about it.\\n[Bea] You all good?\\nShut the fuck up now!\\nThanks again.\\nStay out of the water, yeah?\\nWant some coffee?\\n[Bea] Not the stuff from here. I’ll be up all night.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Thanks for kind of saving me though.\\nIt was fun.\\n[Bea] Stupid, but fun.\\nWell, that’s the best kind.\\n\\nNo, no, no, it’s hot!\\n[Bea] I’m warm.\\nWhen are you ever gonna learn? Like, you want me to blow on it? … Is it still hot?\\nWe’re getting pretty good at faking it.\\n[Bea] I don’t even know what’s real anymore. Everything I do just feels like a mistake.\\nBen, Steve, are you guys all right?\\nBen, wait, you hear?\\nI can’t hear you.\\nSteve!\\nBeatrice! Beatrice!\\n\\nHoney, what are these? Is that a handprint?\\nNo.\\nCome on, baby gorgeous. We got chores. Come on, let’s go. Ben, are you ready? We got groom stuff to do.\\nDude, I’m coming, I’m coming.\\nMan, I hope you scrub from top to bottom, ’cause who knows what was in that heart rate.\\nI also showered last night.\\nTwo showers in eight hours? Go off, King, get clean!\\n[Bea] Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?\\nYes, I’m so excited to marry Claudia. But, you know, I’m also hosting a party where it feels like we’re all playing parts in a play, and I’m not really into the pageantry, and I kinda just wanna do a little–\\n[Bea] All that matters is that you and Claudia run for the rest of your lives together.\\nI love you.\\n[Bea] I love you too.\\nBae? Hey, you’re still good to get the cake, right?\\n[Bea] Yes, ma’am.\\nAwesome. I put Margaret on it with you, just to be safe.\\n[Bea] Margaret.\\n\\nAll right, talk to me, baby. Who’s it gonna be, Margaret or Bae?\\nCome on, man, don’t give me that.\\nWe’re just two girls talking. I get it, though. It’s tough. Magpie’s your dream girl. She’s confident, beautiful, and she knows how to put out a fire with her attire. Now Bae’s waxing her other hand. Whoo! She’s smart, funny, quick, and she got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of.\\nPeter.\\nWhat? I’m not objectifying Margaret, man. That’d be inappropriate. That’s my cousin.\\nIt’s inappropriate with Bae too.\\nThis is deeper than I thought. Hey, Sydney! My boy is in love!\\nStop, dude, just stop.\\nWhat?\\nI know what you’re doing. I know what you’ve all been doing. You set us up, and we went along with it. But it’s fake.\\nIt was my stepdad, right? He can’t act for shit.\\nYou suck too, bro.\\nThat’s foul, dog. It’s definitely gotta be Bae, man.\\nI don’t know, man. I don’t fucking know. She doesn’t know what she wants. She’s single for basically the first time in her life. She just quit law school. Her fucking fiancé’s here.\\nMan, stop with all the white boy–\\nWhat the–\\nHey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Seriously. Anytime something gets real, you run away, call yourself a fuckboy, make an excuse, and you just move on to the next. It’s Bae. You jumped off a boat for her.\\nOh, that’s perfect.\\n[Bea] They’re gonna love it. Thank you so much.\\nLet me get this boxed up for you.\\nThank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nI don’t get all the pageantry of weddings. If you like someone, give ’em a snog. Keep it to yourselves.\\n[Bea] I wore a wedding dress for Halloween for five years in a row.\\nStop it.\\n[Bea] No, I know. It’s so pathetic. But I am with you now. This is not for me.\\nSo you and Ben aren’t serious?\\n[Bea] What? No, no, it’s just… we’re just situationally together.\\n‘Cause when I saw you last night in the harbor, I thought it might be more with you two.\\n[Bea] Just…situationally.\\nIs that an American thing?\\n[Bea] I don’t even know.\\nSo you’re right if I have a go at him, then? I feel like I might have made a mistake letting him loose. If that’s not okay, just tell me. For real.\\n[Bea] I know he really likes you.\\n\\nHow do you think I should play this with Ben? Should I wait until after the wedding?\\n[Bea] Um…I don’t know.\\nHave you guys hooked up?\\nHey.\\nWe’re Beatrice.\\nYou quit school?\\nYou’re just gonna pour gasoline on everything you’ve worked for?\\nIs there still time to re-enroll?\\nSoon as you broke up with Jonathan, everything turned to pot. Are you on drugs? Because at least then I’d understand.\\n[Bea] Who told you I quit law school? Was it Ben?\\nYou quit school?\\nWhat?\\nWhen were you gonna tell us?\\nIs this to get back at us? I’m sorry if we pushed you to succeed your whole life. We’re such awful parents.\\n[Bea] Mom, this isn’t about you.\\nYes it is. It is about us. And no, we’re not gonna let you throw away your life because you’re going through something. Everyone is always going through something. It’s called life.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] I can’t believe you. You told him I quit school?\\nNo, I didn’t.\\nYou told Pete. Pete told us.\\nShit.\\nI told you what?\\nYeah, no, I told Pete, but I didn’t mean it like that.\\nTold me what?\\nThat we’re gonna find out at some point.\\n[Bea] That’s not for you to decide.\\nI’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.\\nIt doesn’t matter how we found out.\\nFound out what?\\nShe quit law school.\\nOh, yeah, I knew that.\\n[Bea] You’re real shit.\\nI made a mistake. I’m sorry.\\n[Bea] There’s a reason why you’re alone. No one can trust you.\\nYeah, what’s your reason?\\n[Bea] Guys like you.\\nKeep telling yourself that.\\n[Bea] Fuck off.\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. Don’t do this right here, right now. I messed this all up. It’s all on me.\\nWhy don’t we all go for a swim, eh? Cool off before the wedding?\\nThat’s a great idea. Maybe early drinks?\\n[Bea] Guys, I am so sorry, but your plan is all ruined. We are not together. We were faking it the whole time.\\nYou knew?\\nWhat are they even talking about?\\nWell, we may have orchestrated a union between the pair of them in order for peace to prevail across the land.\\nYou lied to us? What have you been honest about lately?\\nSo you lied to me too? You’re not together?\\n[Bea] I could never be with someone like him.\\nYeah, ’cause I’m the one who fucked it up.\\n[Bea] You did fuck it up.\\nI fucked it up?\\n[Bea] Yeah, you fucked it up.\\nI fucked it up?\\n[Bea] You fucked it up.\\nOh, no.\\nBad dog, Kalonofin.\\nI mean, good dog, you killed that shit, but next time read the room, Kaymoney.\\n[Bea] I am so sorry.\\nHey, uh…\\nBae.\\nI think he’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine.\\n\\nGood?\\nYou’re perfect.\\nRelax, you’re working yourself up.\\nIt is not fine. It is not everything. It is fine. Okay, all we asked of them was to come out here, celebrate us, and they are ruining it.\\nAnd all week and I have been so stressed, and you’ve been more worried about what’s going on with bae than with me.\\nWell, you’ve been more concerned about your planning. Are you marrying me or your itinerary?\\nWell, if that’s how you feel, then why are we even doing this?\\nI don’t know. You tell me.\\n\\nThere’s one last thing we need to fake.\\nClaudia, Allie, we’re assholes.\\nWe’re really sorry.\\nI’m a terrible sister, and he’s a terrible friend.\\nIt’s your guys’ big day.\\nWe’re not gonna mess it up, we promise.\\nUh-huh, but just so you both know,\\nif you fuck up today, the something I borrowed\\nis a knife, and it’s shiny and new.\\nLove is intoxicating.\\nIt envelops you, it tickles you,\\nand it makes you feel like you can walk on air.\\nIt’s like this wind.\\nIt’s in your bones, it’s in your breath,\\nit’s in every beat of your heart.\\nYou can’t look for it, you can’t describe it,\\nand you can’t escape it.\\nAllie, I love you so much,\\nand I don’t think I say it enough.\\nYou are the yin to my yang,\\npeanut butter to my jelly,\\nand I will love you forever and always.\\nClaudia, I love you with so much of my heart\\nthat none is left to protest.\\nThat’s very good.\\nJust made it up.\\nA lot of it.\\nI now pronounce you married!\\nYeah!\\nOh, look, there she is.\\nOh, hey, parents.\\nIs that Tasmania?\\nYeah.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI am so sorry I lied to you guys about school.\\nI didn’t want to disappoint you guys again.\\nWell, if you’d just told us, maybe we could have–\\nTrying to talk me out of it?\\nNo, maybe we could have supported you.\\nI know this is scary for you guys.\\nYeah, it’s scary for me too,\\nand I gotta figure it out on my own.\\nI know that every now and then\\nwe might come off as a little…\\nControlling?\\nNo.\\nOverbearing?\\nNo.\\nActually crazy?\\nYes.\\nThat’s it, but only because we love you so much.\\nLove you.\\nGood luck.\\nGood luck.\\nHi, Aunt.\\nYes?\\nDo you mind if I steal a hand?\\nUh, not at all.\\nGo ahead.\\nHigh five.\\nHey.\\nHi.\\nWhere’s Bo?\\nHe buggered off.\\nHe said he saw a wave he couldn’t morally not surf.\\nI’m sorry.\\nIt was never really anything.\\nAnd you and Bea.\\nShe said you were just situational.\\nShe said that?\\nAre you good?\\nYeah, we know it’s been a tough weekend for you.\\nI don’t know.\\nThese last few days really made me realize how much I miss you.\\nWhy don’t you just go for a walk?\\nFigure your head.\\nYeah, we’ll go with you.\\nNo, we won’t.\\nNo.\\nI love you, but this is our wedding.\\nSo…\\nAre you sure?\\nYeah.\\nI might go and do some people watching.\\nJust not… these people.\\nThank you.\\nWow.\\nBen.\\nI wanted this for so long.\\nBut I think I’m just holding on to a memory.\\nAnd also, I… I’m sorry.\\nI’m so sorry.\\nI’ve never seen Bea like this before.\\nReally?\\nYou were the one who said there’s a thin line between love and hate.\\nYou’re always the first person to say that bit, you know?\\nI know it sounds crazy, but even when they were yapping at each other, I’ve never seen Bea happier.\\nSame with Ben.\\nHey, stepfather, may I have a word?\\nYes, but make it quick, son.\\nI promised my lady a dance, but don’t tell your mother.\\nYou’re so clever.\\nYou know who’s also clever?\\nBen.\\nYou know who else would be perfect for Ben?\\nThat mumbly girl who always looks like she’s got a secret.\\nYou know her name is Bea.\\nThat was a callback.\\nWill you stop?\\nStop.\\nHow you going, mate? How you going, Ben?\\nWhat, you two?\\nWhat?\\nJust enough with the loud talking and the overhearing.\\nJust stop.\\nBro, we literally didn’t know you were standing there.\\nYeah, it’s true. We didn’t know you were listening.\\nWe did.\\nIt was greatly a performance for one.\\nAnd we nailed it, too.\\nWhat is with you people?\\nThis entire weekend, I have been lied to and manipulated and puppeteered.\\nI don’t know what is real and what is not.\\nMate, I know you’re a little blurry, but I meant what I said up there about love.\\nIt’s too precious a resource to be wasted.\\nI haven’t seen her. Is she, uh–\\nShe went on a walk a while ago.\\nAfter she saw you kissing Margaret.\\nWhat?\\nNo, I didn’t kiss Margaret.\\nMargaret kissed me. I backed up.\\nI don’t want to be with Margaret.\\nI want to–\\nStop it.\\nYou gorgeous idiot.\\nRun.

Are you crazy?\\nPlease ask a favor!\\nWhy don’t you just treat people like my folks?\\nJust go get the girl.\\nThank you!\\nExcuse me!\\nExcuse me!\\nI didn’t kiss Margaret. She kissed me.\\nI know that’s a bullshit excuse, but it’s true.\\nI couldn’t find a moving train.\\nSorry, it’s the best I could do.\\nAre you out of your mind?\\nYeah.\\nBecause it’s been two years since we met\\nand I haven’t spent every single day with you.\\nThat’s the sign of a crazy person.\\nI hated you.\\nI didn’t really give you a choice.\\nI definitely didn’t hate you.\\nYou called me a bitch.\\nI said you were acting like a bitch.\\nNo, I was a bitch.\\nThe way I handled everything.\\nThe way I handled the first night.\\nThe way I handled last night.\\nYeah, it wasn’t really awesome.\\nWhy did you leave?\\nI thought you were going to regret it.\\nAnd I couldn’t face the idea of losing someone else that I… I really loved.\\nLast night was the first thing I haven’t regretted in a long time.\\nI love the way we fight.\\nI love how smart you are.\\nI love the weird way you stick your hands down my pants.\\nAnd I love how you know what you don’t want.\\nAnd if it’s not me, if I don’t check all your boxes,\\nif I’m not the one, I get it.\\nThat would really, really fucking suck.\\nSo, you gonna kiss me now?\\nYeah, I am.\\nThat’s a lot of running for Mr. No Cardio.\\nYeah, I’m dying.

              "{'anyone but you': ['\\n\\nBea, a law student with doubts about her path, connects instantly with the charming, yet arrogant, Ben on a whirlwind first date. Their passion cools overnight, however, leaving Bea heartbroken and fuming after overhearing Ben’s dismissive remarks to a friend. Years later, fate throws them together at a luxurious Australian wedding, forcing them to share space and endure awkward family gatherings – not helped by the presence of Bea’s persistent ex-fiancé and Ben’s jealous ex-girlfriend.\\nIn an attempt to ease the tension and ensure a smooth celebration, the wedding party hatches a mischievous plan: convince everyone Bea and Ben are a happy couple. Despite initial resistance, fuelled by personal motives, both agree to the charade. Bea seeks escape from her ex’s shadow, while Ben hopes to spark jealousy in his old flame.\\nAs they navigate the masquerade, participating in romantic couple activities and faking intimate moments, something unexpected happens. The line between pretense and reality blurs. Underneath the bickering and witty banter, they discover unexpected vulnerabilities and shared passions, leading to a genuine connection they can’t ignore.\\nTheir budding romance faces obstacles: Jonathan’s disapproval, Bea’s overbearing parents, and the inevitable exposure of their charade. But through humorous confrontations and self-reflection, they learn to trust each other and fight for their newfound love. In the end, defying expectations and overcoming external pressures, Ben and Bea choose to embrace their feelings, leaving the future open to exciting possibilities.\\nTheir journey is not just about finding love, but also about self-discovery. Bea sheds her insecurities and carves her own path, while Ben confronts his emotional walls and learns to be vulnerable. Their relationship, born from a playful ruse, blossoms into something authentic and true, reminding us that love can sometimes surprise us in the most unexpected places.\\n\\n* * *\\n[Bea] Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.\\n[Bea] Hi. Where’s your bathroom?\\nIt’s for customers only.\\n[Bea] Oh, okay. I’ll buy something.\\nYou gotta pay up there.\\n[Bea] Can I just go now? I really have to pee.\\nI’ve got a large cappuccino for Skylar.\\nThanks.\\n[Bea] I also kind of, well, no… I know that establishments that serve food or drink must be open to the public regardless of their purchasing class.\\nSorry, it’s our policy.\\n[Bea] Store policy can’t really supersede state law. Please, it’s an emergency.\\nCaramel latte for Miranda.\\nHoney, I’m about to order. Do you want your usual?\\n[Bea] Uh.\\nMy wife would like a double espresso although you’ve had trouble sleeping lately, right babe? Maybe we should back it off to a single. You kept the light on until like midnight last night.\\n[Bea] I did, didn’t I? Yeah, so maybe I’ll just have a peppermint tea with two sugars. Thanks, husband.\\nOh, and the bread. It’s grilled cheese night. And she is part of the purchasing class, so can we get the bathroom key? Thank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you. That was really nice.\\nHappy to. You knew a lot about bathroom law.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] It was a short chapter. Thank you.\\nOh. I’ll have your tea waiting for you. Can’t leave my wife.\\n[Bea] Oh. Okay. That’s great. I will see you on the other side.\\n\\n[Bea] Hallie, I just met this guy and I don’t know, it was something. Well, I know it’s been a while, but I’m pretty sure he bought me a tea and he might have just stolen my coat. But what do I do? Oh no, this is the time that I’m supposed to be meeting people and doing things. Hallie, I gotta call you back. God damn it.\\nAre you okay?\\n[Bea] Big time. I am big time okay. I just had to pee for like the last six hours and I just started this new internship. And I didn’t want to ask anyone where the bathroom was because I didn’t want them to think I was weak and not a problem solver.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. Every human does it. It’s very, very normal.\\nYeah.\\nPeppermint tea, two sugars.\\n[Bea] Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Hi.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nOh, hey. You…\\n[Bea] So are you going to ask me out now?\\nYeah. Yeah, I am. I’m Ben.\\n[Bea] I’m Bea.\\n[Bea] So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, you would not be able to protect us?\\nNo, no. You’d be dead.\\n[Bea] You would let me die?\\nI’m not going to let you die. I’m just going to survive. You’re right. You’re right. You’re right.\\n[Bea] I was a gymnast.\\nGymnast?\\n[Bea] Yes. For like five years. I got like sixth place on beam.\\n\\n\\n\\nSixth place?\\n[Bea] Yes. Got a ribbon.\\nI’m impressed.\\n[Bea] Everybody gets a ribbon.\\nAll right, wait to cool down. You just saw me take it off the burning stove.\\n[Bea] Oh, my God.\\nIf you’re going to be a lawyer, you got to understand negligence and breach and McDonald’s versus that lady’s habeas corpus.\\n[Bea] You used none of those terms properly.\\nHow do you know? You’re not a lawyer yet. It’s not too late to choose a more noble profession.\\n[Bea] Oh, like you?\\nYou’re right. Stick with it. I’m going to need a lawyer at some point.\\n[Bea] I don’t even know if I want to be a lawyer. I cannot believe I just said that out loud. I’m sorry. My life is a disaster right now.\\nMight be turning the corner. You just met me.\\n[Bea] Or I might end up in a suitcase. I mean, look at this place. It looks like every serial killer reenactment documentary. Why do you have a giant wrench?\\nOkay, it wouldn’t be a suitcase. It’d be a carry-on because you’re zero feet tall. And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how broken something is, there’s always a way to fix it. I’m sorry. I don’t know why I’m talking to you about my mom right now.\\n[Bea] Alright. Then tell me about that.\\nThat is a long story. Everybody survived.\\n[Bea] Great.\\n[Bea] Holly, I don’t know this guy. He’s fucking great.\\nYo, let’s go, Benny. Come on, cupcake. We’re gonna be late.\\n‘Sup, Pete.\\nNo way. You cooked? That girl you blew me off for stayed over?\\n[Bea] He asked me out and then I kind of asked him out and then we just walked around the city and we fell asleep talking. I don’t– I left before you could wake up. I don’t know why. Why did I? What the fuck am I doing? Okay, I love you. Bye. I’m so sorry I woke you up. I didn’t– This whole thing is so new to me. Bye.\\nYou got cheese and bread. You didn’t miss one ingredient. What you doing with that? Why you got the giant wrench? You told her about your mom, bro? You don’t tell nobody about your mom. Fuck, dog. You in love, man. About fucking time, man. My boy’s in love.\\nFuck that. I couldn’t get her out of here fast enough. This girl’s a disaster. She’s a nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIX MONTHS LATER\\nWant to get a mansion, a jacuzzi, a theater to watch my movies, a couple whips and lots of fancy things.\\nThe kids, they call the goonies.\\nI see the future crystal ball, mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall.\\nGot your girlfriend screaming all the cops.\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nClaudia.\\nHolly.\\nThere we go.\\nHey, what’s up, Glee?\\nBen, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.\\nAre we saying that now?\\nYeah, is that cool?\\nYeah, I mean, I don’t really like labels, but I like you a whole bunch. I like your friend a whole bunch. And if she wants to put a label on me, then she can sew it on wherever she wants. That was weird. That was weird. I’m not into S&M or anything like that, unless you are, which would be totally cool, you know? You do you.\\nWell, she really likes you, too. And that is very rare for her.\\nOh, look who’s talking.\\nHow’s the crowd in here tonight?\\nOver there, big boy.\\nOh, B.\\nDo ladies like dumplings? We just had the greatest dumplings.\\nPete, meet my sister. This is Pete, Claudia’s brother.\\n[Bea] Nice to meet you.\\nAnd Ben. Ben. This is Ben. We all grew up together.\\nHey.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nYou two know each other?\\nYeah, we met.\\n[Bea] Barely.\\nWow, that’s so random.\\n[Bea] I’m going to go grab a drink.\\nDoor’s that way if you’re looking to sneak out. I know that’s your thing.\\n[Bea] Well, I am a disaster.\\nLet’s go away from this.\\nYeah.\\nSo you a lawyer yet?\\n[Bea] Why? Do you need a defense attorney?\\nI’m just curious how you passed the class on ethics and not bailing on people.\\nI think that’s the jerk who B got with when she was on her break from Jonathan.\\nNo way. So B’s the coffee girl who ghosted him?\\nI thought she looked familiar, but I don’t see faces. I just see souls.\\nAt least he made her realize that Jonathan was the one.\\n[Bea] I’m engaged now.\\nGood for you. Where are you registered? I’ll buy you a broomstick.\\n[Bea] I’ll send you an invite. You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?\\nYou do remember. See, it did mean something to you.\\n[Bea] You’ll always be my rock bottom. The night I spent with a bitch.\\nDid she just call him a bitch?\\nYou think they’re going to physically fight?\\nOr fuck?\\nThat’s a fine line.\\n[Bea] Let’s just get through tonight for them, OK?\\nElle, she’s your sister. I’m sure the relationship won’t last long.\\n[Bea] She’s your friend. I question why they’re even together.\\nThen I’m going to get a drink and toast to never seeing you again.\\n[Bea] Cheers to that, bro.\\n\\nANYONE BUT YOU\\nSo before I pronounce this newlywed couple, if anyone has an issue with these two wonderful people joining together in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.\\nI have an objection.\\nLeo, don’t do this.\\nI have to, Annie. It’s just not right. There’s no way I can bless this union without their friends and family joining us to celebrate in Australia.\\nWe’re getting married in Sydney.\\n\\nWelcome on board. 2K to the front.\\nThank you, Sheryl.\\n51E, how long’s the flight?\\n16 hours. 51F, thanks. 73F, all the way to the back.\\nHey. Head of the wedding?\\n[Bea] Of my sister, yes, I am.\\nHow crazy is it that we’re on the same plane?\\n[Bea] Don’t think there’s thousands of flights flying to Sydney every day.\\nOh, there’s quite a few, actually. Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, some co-chairs. Serendipity, I guess.\\n[Bea] I don’t think that word means what you think it means.\\nSo where’s your fiance? Wait, is this him? Hey, I’m Ben. I was her hall pass on your break.\\nWhat?\\nOh my god, I forgot. Claude told me you dumped him. Did you sneak out on your wedding day?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Wow, you are a child.\\nIt’s a pretty long flight. Do you want anything from the front of the boat? Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?\\n[Bea] No, thank you. I’m all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.\\nNothing small about me.\\nWhat the fuck?\\nHave a good flight. See you there.\\n\\nWhy do so many of us feel stuck? How is it even a very successful? Often feel like there is something missing from their lives. Why do so many people spend years mystically thinking about choices they might have made? One answer to that problem, many of us are leading lives that are misaligned with our own deepest values and preferences.\\nThank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain. What psychology can teach us about living our most authentic lives?\\n[Bea] What the fuck?\\n\\nHey, Vinny! Vindale! OK, Vin, looking good.\\nThanks for picking me up, dude.\\nNot just you, my guy.\\nSpelling Bee!\\n[Bea] Hey!\\nOur sisters are getting married. How dope is that?\\n[Bea] I know, I’m so excited.\\nOh, great. All right, let’s hit it.\\nThank you. I hope all of you have a wonderful vacation. I wish you all the best for the Mid-Autumn Festival.\\nBye.\\nY’all ready for Australia?\\nCan’t wait for y’all to see where we stay. And the plan is so dope.\\nWe’re all staying at the same place?\\nYep, my stepdad’s house. Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.\\n[Bea] Sounds like a piece of information that could have been shared a little earlier.\\nWell, that’s because they think you guys hate each other, so they didn’t want to poke the beard.\\n\\nNot bad, right?\\nYou don’t even play tennis.\\nI know, but I feel sweet.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee, y’all.\\nMeet Kalonabee.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee.\\nAll over.\\nAll over.\\nSpin, spin, spin.\\nWoo-hoo!\\nHe was the only member of the family who was trans.\\nYeah, he was there.\\n[Bea] Whoa.\\nYou’re right. This place is insane.\\nI know. All right, let’s get some sand under your feet.\\nHave you guys made up?\\nAll good.\\n[Bea] We’re fine if he just stays away from me.\\nDon’t need an invitation for that.\\n[Bea] I think you do if you’re like this. You can’t leave me alone.\\nSame reason I slowed down at the car crash.\\nOkay, so you guys buried the hatchet, water under the bridge, two adults adulting like fucking adults.\\nOh, we did have a little bit of a last minute snafu though. You guys are gonna have to share a room. There’s only one bed, but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.\\nShe’s kidding.\\n[Bea] You’re funny. I can’t wait any longer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWait for me!\\nHallie’s such a goof.\\nShe’s good for you. She could use some spontaneity.\\nHey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.\\nI hope so. I have a million contingencies and scenarios for everything. And honestly, I just want this wedding to be beautiful because I love the shit out of her and I just wanna marry the bitch, you know what I’m saying?\\nYou’re such a romantic.\\nHey, don’t be mad at me, but Margaret’s here.\\nWhy would I be mad? She lives here, I was 100% expecting to see her.\\nYeah. Margaret, Margaret, look who’s here.\\nThere she is. 100%.\\nGo rip off the band-aid.\\nBabe!\\nHow’s it going, stranger?\\nI was hoping you’d come. I wanted to message you, but I didn’t know how you’d feel about hearing from me.\\nAre you kidding?\\n[Bea] I’m never leaving.\\nNever leave.\\n[Bea] How are mom and dad?\\nThey’re good. You know, mom now thinks she’s Australian and dad’s not at all pointing out every tiny little detail that’s different. They’re also a little worried how you’re gonna react to all this.\\n[Bea] What are you talking about?\\nWell, you know, everybody thought that you’d be the one getting married first. You always used to talk about your wedding growing up. You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress when I just used it to dress like a mummy, you know?\\n[Bea] Hallie, stop. That’s not me anymore. I’m free now. I’m deprogrammed. That does not mean I don’t support you and your misguided view that soulmates exist.\\nThat’s sweet. Is that gonna be your toast?\\n[Bea] You and Claudia are the exception. I’m really happy for you, for real. What’s going on over there?\\nThat’s Claudia’s cousin. She visited the States a few years back. They dated. No biggie. Broke up with him. Crushed his heart.\\nNo way, that man does not have a heart.\\nFeels like forever ago. We were babies.\\nI’m really happy you’re here. We can reconnect as maybe not babies.\\nI would love that. Beau! Come eat my mate. Ben, this is my partner, Beau.\\nHi, mate.\\nLike, tennis partner?\\nSometimes after. How do you two dags know each other?\\nWe had a bit of a go back when, didn’t we?\\nDid you now? Good on ya. Hey, we’re gonna go trotting this weekend. Hit up the turps out here, eh? It’s gonna be a cracker. Woo!\\nYou know it.\\nGreat guy.\\nYeah.\\n\\nMommy!\\nHey, Beatrice.\\n[Bea] Dad!\\nYou made it.\\nOh, baby.\\nHi, baby.\\nHi, honey.\\nOh, my God.\\nWow.\\nHow’s our future lawyer?\\n[Bea] Great.\\nGreat.\\n[Bea] How’s the trip been?\\nOh, magical. The Australians are all wonderful. And excuse me, but good looking.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nWhy are they so weird about their plugs? I mean, this place is basically America. They speak English, they eat regular food, they have a complicated relationship with their past.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI’m doing okay.\\n[Bea] I’m doing great. My big sister’s getting married.\\nCould have been you. Could still be you someday.\\nHave you heard from Jonathan? Did he call or anything?\\nWell, that didn’t take long.\\nWe’re just torn up that he’s not part of our family anymore.\\nI mean, he works at our house every night from like 11 years old. He was basically family. Was about to be actual family.\\n[Bea] If I never ask you for anything ever again, can you please just lay off of me this weekend?\\nI just want both of our daughters to be happy.\\n[Bea] I’m very happy, but not when you guys do this.\\nNed, you in the right direction? He’s such a great guy. Just think on it, yeah?\\n\\nBee, dinner at 7.30, okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Yeah.\\nBen, all set for dinner, yeah?\\nYeah, I’ll be there.\\n\\nI was plagiarizing.\\nHey!\\nHi Ben!\\nHey Ben!\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nEverybody?\\nDad’s speech.\\nOh yes, right, okay. We’re gonna make this short, because you’ve all traveled a bloody long distance, and Carol and I are so appreciative. Biggest thing we’ve missed since coming back from the States is not seeing our kids. And you lot, our extended family, so we’re just over the moon to have a full house before the wedding on Sunday.\\nWhere we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia, setting off on this crazy thing called life. And of course, Innie and Leo, our new family.\\nWell, we’re just so grateful, not only for your incredible hospitality, but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.\\nSo as they say in our country, abondanza.\\nCheers!\\nNow baby.\\nWow!\\nWhat classes are you loving? Have you given any more thought to tort law? ‘Cause class action is really where it’s at right now. What does Jonathan say? He knows you pretty well. What does he think you should do?\\n[Bea] Mom.\\nOkay.\\nI can’t even remember why we put you in the truck again. We didn’t put her in the trunk, she stowed away in the trunk.\\nYeah, I wanted to go with you guys to see Cinderella.\\nWe were going to Coachella.\\nI know that now, it was nice.\\nAll right, everyone. So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy. Let’s just have a moment to calm ourselves. I am not looking at anybody in particular, but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.\\nCrown chakra.\\nLet’s hit that cobra.\\nCleanse, get that weasel.\\nOkay.\\nGo!\\nYou go, you go.\\nSign of the times.\\nAll right, all right, four words.\\nFirst word, the, A, of, if.\\nAnimosity, hate, liar.\\nFive words.\\n[Bea] No, just shut the fuck up.\\nThe Bible.\\nA woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality to take advantage of other people.\\nMom, focus, okay? Right here, right here.\\nThis is a white people’s game. Y’all spend so much time trying to trick each other. Y’all got so much time on your hands. Just say the word.\\nIt’s on the extreme.\\nGrumpy old man.\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nOkay, okay, yeah, okay.\\n[Bea] Fuck boy.\\nOld cat woman.\\n[Bea] Your ego.\\nOkay.\\nWhat is this?\\n[Bea] Wait, no props.\\nNo one cares, no one can see us.\\n[Bea] Cheaters are shocking.\\nSays the woman who cheated on her fiance.\\n[Bea] We were on a break, asshole.\\nYou’re either broken up for good, or you’re cheating. Either way, someone’s lying to someone.\\n[Bea] I must have really gotten under your skin.\\nRoger, what is this?\\nFat, five.\\nWhat is the thing I’m holding in my hand?\\nFireworks.\\nFireworks by Katy Perry.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] That is not fair.\\nHey, what, you’re not fair. What’s wrong with you? Just stop.\\n[Bea] What are you doing?\\nWhat is wrong with you?\\n[Bea] Stop.\\nOh God.\\nOh God.\\nSam, what the?\\nOh my God.\\nAli.\\nGet back.\\nSam.\\nRoger.\\nI’ve got this.\\nThat’s some gangster shit right there.\\nSorry.\\n[Bea] Sorry.\\n\\nThey’re going to ruin our wedding.\\nAll that matters is that we’re together.\\nIt’s true.\\nLook baby, I love you to the moon and back, but those two fuckwads are going to destroy our weekend, and our memories, which we are going to have for a very long time, are headed straight over a cliff.\\nIt’s going to be fine baby, we just have to. to stand there and profess our love.\\nIt seems to me, their animus only surfaced after they spent a night together. Am I accurate?\\nThat’s usually how it goes, honey.\\nWe crumple our feelings into a ball and shove ’em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.\\nThe solution appears to be simple then. We return them to the night they were spent.\\nLike we trick them into falling in love with each other?\\nHe didn’t say anything about love, honey. We just need to get them to jump each other’s bones.\\n\\nYeah, come on!\\nThat was good, right?\\nThat was good.\\nYou go, you go, you go, you go, you go.\\nShe clearly has eyes for Ben.\\nWho does, father?\\nHallie Spence, the sister. The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.\\nYou can’t say that. What the hell?\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that was rude. I apologize to anyone that was listening, which can only be you, Pete, ’cause you’re the only person that was listening. I apologize.\\nI accept your apology and will now move on. Do you know Bea’s been in love with Ben since the first night they met?\\nWell, why didn’t she tell him? You know, when I was a young bloke and I liked a girl, I would sneak up behind her and I’d cut a lock of her hair and then I’d smack her on the bum!\\nWhat the hell?\\nI don’t know, I’m not good at this, sorry.\\nBea was just too scared to tell him, but I’ve talked to her and she says she regrets walking out that morning.\\nTell me more, son.\\nWhy me?\\nBecause you’re really good at it, right? You can do it.\\nWhy me, why? Why you put this hat on me? No one can see me, it’s a radio play, motherfucker. Bea wants us to tell him how much she likes him, so he lets his guard down and goes to her. Some Cupid’s killed with arrows and some with traps.\\nThat was good, I like that, that’s good.\\nI just made it up.\\nSo, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers, and say, “Come to Papa.”\\nWhat are you doing?\\nI’m from a different generation.\\nAnd your generation sucks. You fucked up the whole world for us.\\nAnd I’m full of shame. But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.\\nBut Ben feels awful that he called her a disaster. I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.\\nThen why is he fighting with her?\\nWell, because he likes her.\\nAnd I know that Bea likes Ben. She’s just denying herself because she’s got in her head somehow that she’ll never love again.\\nWhoa, I’m not talking about love, baby. I’m talking about dick.\\nOh, it’s Ben.\\nOh.\\nHey. You.\\n[Bea] Oh God, they got to you too?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia say how much I like you?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really?\\nIt was Pete and Roger.\\n[Bea] Fantastic, it’s a team effort. They’re trying to get us together.\\nNo way.\\n[Bea] Come here.\\nOh, maybe they want us to stop acting like assholes so we don’t ruin the biggest event of their lives.\\n[Bea] Us? There is no us and assholes. You’re the one who destroyed the living room.\\nWould you two mind helping me with something? I hate to ask, but I’d really appreciate it.\\nSure.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\n\\nSo Roger left his sunglasses on the sailboat. I swear, if his head wasn’t screwed on, we’d use it as a bowling ball. Do me a favor and swim out and get them. It’s the one on the right.\\nBoth of us.\\n[Bea] Is that really a two person job?\\nDoesn’t seem like it.\\nYou two. Yeah.\\n[Bea] All right, so everyone’s involved in this.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] I feel bad.\\nMe too.\\n[Bea] I don’t want to bum Holly and Claudia out.\\nJust me and you.\\n[Bea] Can you not swim?\\nI’m an excellent swimmer.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of breath?\\nI’m fine. How much further do you think?\\n[Bea] Are your eyes closed?\\nI think it’s dark.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of shape? You have like a 10 pop.\\nI’m not out of shape. I’ve been to 295, 300 once. I just don’t do cardio.\\n[Bea] Oh my God, you’re hot girl fit.\\nI’m not hot girl fit.\\n[Bea] Okay, my bad. We’ll see you at the boat.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nI could have done it myself, but whatever. Thanks.\\n[Bea] No fucking way.\\nHoney, look who’s here.\\n[Bea] I cannot believe they did this.\\nWho is that?\\n[Bea] That is my ex, Jonathan.\\nHey, hey.\\nWhat is he doing here?\\n[Bea] My Black Hawk helicopter parents have been trying to get us back together for the past four months.\\nThey flew him halfway across the world to your sister’s wedding? That’s some deep off shit. They came to play.\\n[Bea] That’s my parents. They think I’m throwing my life away.\\nHoney, we’re just gonna take him back and get him all settled in.\\nI’ll see you later.\\n[Bea] You know, maybe we should do it. Just tell everyone we’re together.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] It would solve that problem for me and that problem for you.\\nI don’t have a problem.\\n[Bea] You clearly want Margaret.\\nNo, I don’t.\\n[Bea] Yes, you do. I saw the way you looked at her last night and I know she broke your heart. She sees you’re with me. She wants what she can’t have and then bye bye crocodile Jack. Fuck, he’s fast.\\nMaking her jealous is not gonna work. We’re not in seventh grade.\\n[Bea] Trust me, bro. We’re all in seventh grade when it comes to this stuff. They’ve already gone through all of the bullshit trying to trick us into each other’s arms. Let’s just embrace it.\\nThere’s no way we can convince anyone we actually like each other.\\n[Bea] Yeah, you’re right.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] You know, I still think about that night we spent together.\\nShut up.\\n[Bea] No, I’m serious. You know, this could be kind of fun. We’re at a wedding a million miles away from home. Who knows what could happen under the cover of a masquerade. And that night at your place, no matter how it ended, it was still pretty amazing. … Convincing enough?\\nFuck it. Let’s do it. … Just wait. Wait.\\nOkay, okay. Whoever wants to go on the hike, we need to leave now. We’re running behind schedule.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nBabe, the mountains have been there for millions of years. A few more minutes isn’t gonna hurt them.\\nBaby, I know you are trying to calm me down and I love you for it. Thank you. But I am hurting cats right now and I need some help instead of this easy breezy Martin Scorsese.\\nAw, jitters. Remember our wedding?\\nOnly that you’re the most beautiful bride on God’s green earth.\\nRight answer.\\nWe’re coming, we’re coming, we’re coming.\\nJinx, you owe me a cup.\\nOh, you have a little something in your teeth.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.\\nYeah, let me just take that out.\\nOh, I gotta get it out.\\nOh, it’s right there.\\nGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.\\nHoney, here he is.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] Jonathan.\\nSo nice to see you.\\n[Bea] I had no idea you were coming.\\nSo your parents didn’t tell you, okay? Yeah, you know, the first thing I asked them when they invited me was, “Does B know?” ‘Cause otherwise this would be really fucking awkward. And now it is fucking awkward.\\nNo, no, not at all.\\nI’m in a lot of love.\\nNo, you’re like family. It’d be effing awkward if you weren’t here.\\nI’m so glad you’re here.\\nI’m so happy for you two. Hey, congratulations.\\nYeah, thanks.\\nRight?\\n[Bea] It’s great to see you.\\nIt’s great to see you too.\\nWe’re all going on a hike, so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out. Let’s move out.\\n[Bea] Ben, meet Jonathan.\\nOh, hey, man.\\nI’m Ben.\\nHey, oh, Pete and Claudia’s friend, right?\\nAlso friends with Bea, among other things.\\nYeah, it’s nice to meet you.\\nOkay, plenty of enough time in the car to do whatever the fuck this is. Come on, let’s go!\\nYeah, okay. Yeah.\\n[Bea] We need to come up with a game plan.\\nYeah, you are so terrible at this.\\n[Bea] What?\\nWe’re doing this thing!\\nHoney, I’m sorry. I know we should have asked you, but we had to invite you.\\nOh, it’s totally fine. I’m glad he’s here. I love him and Holly loves him.\\nReally?\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nGreat, okay. So we’re spending a little time together away from the real world and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, Mom, guys, no. I totally forgot to tell you, but I’m with Ben. … Do you want to come?\\nI think I’m going to hang back and yell at your parents. Have fun.\\n\\nAlright, so is it like we just got together or we’ve been sneaking around? Oh, I got it. What if we ran into each other at Chipotle, lady in the tramp, the burrito?\\n[Bea] No.\\nThis can’t be that hard.\\n[Bea] It’s harder than you think. My parents don’t even believe it yet.\\nYou told them five seconds ago.\\n[Bea] They know I would never go out with a guy like you.\\nYou’ve been with one guy your entire life.\\n[Bea] Jonathan’s a better man than you’ll ever be.\\nAnd yet you left him. Which is why exactly? Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.\\n[Bea] Okay, you don’t know my boxes and you never will. Just figure this out, please.\\nOkay. We just suck face in front of everybody. Half of them think they set us up anyway.\\n[Bea] No, that’s too much. We need to do something that’s more hidden so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.\\nYou’re calling me a fuckboy like it’s an insult? I own that shit.\\n[Bea] Let’s just be affectionate. I know it’s a foreign concept for you.\\nI can be affectionate. I’ll affectionate the shit out of you.\\nI can’t believe your parents invited Jonathan. Now I have to find a table to sit him at.\\nWhat about Bea?\\nNo, no, she’s fine. She’s sitting with us at our table.\\nNo, I’m talking about how she’s already at a low point because she’s going through a breakup and I don’t even know what’s happening with school. She never even talks about it anymore.\\nI guess I could put up with the cousins.\\nWhy?\\nYou alright?\\nOh, shit.\\nWow.\\nCheck it out, guys!\\nNice!\\nYeah!\\nBeautiful!\\nSee, I told you it was going to be good.\\nMan, that’s nice.\\n[Bea] Oh, wow.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] So beautiful.\\nThere it is.\\nFeel the serenity.\\nPretty spectacular, hey?\\nIt’s amazing.\\n[Bea] Alright, your turn.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] This is just so romantic.\\nOkay, nuzzle my neck.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nGet in there. Damn, you are short.\\n[Bea] You are not tall enough to say that.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Oh, are you ticklish?\\nNo, I’m acting.\\n[Bea] Like a toddler?\\nNo, go away. Okay, I can use that.\\n[Bea] Beg me. Beg me to stuff you in the butt.\\nStop! Just let me do it. Permission to put my left hand on your right buttock.\\n[Bea] Granted. Too hard.\\nSorry. You gotta sell it.\\n[Bea] Okay, not in circles. It’s not a magic lamp.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Okay, now you’re just playing bop it.\\nI’ve never rubbed a bopper show.\\n[Bea] Clearly, you’ve tried. Are you not wearing underwear?\\nIt’s a swimsuit. I’m on holiday.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nOkay, just mind the gap.\\n[Bea] How’s that?\\nThat’s good. Just like, but you don’t have to hover. Just kind of, oh, man the woods.\\n[Bea] I’m sorry.\\nOkay, just take it out.\\n[Bea] You try.\\nYou want me to stick my finger in my own ass? How’s that gonna convince? Oh, on you. I can’t. Jesus Christ, it’s like a vacuum pack down here. How’d you get in this thing? Oh, man, it’s tight. Oh, see, it’s like holding a baby bird.\\n[Bea] God damn it.\\nWere they not watching this whole time?\\n[Bea] You like a mole or something on your butt?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really? ‘Cause I feel something.\\nI don’t have a mole. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Are there any more on me?\\n[Bea] I don’t know.\\nJack, spiders hunt bears. They hunt bears.\\nNo pictures. Put the cameras down. We’re not gonna take a spirit.\\nAre there any more?\\n[Bea] I don’t know.\\nWhere are they? I feel it. I feel it.\\n[Bea] I think I see something.\\nWhat do you see? What do you see?\\n[Bea] Oh, no, that’s just a part of you. You’re fine.\\nAll right, look, if I have one of those little fuckers in me, they might be in you.\\n[Bea] I’m good.\\nThat’s probably a better way to check than what I did.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nAll right, little one, we join your journey. We do not inherit the earth. We just borrow it from our creatures.\\nHey, guys. What did we miss?\\nWow.\\n\\nWhy can’t I get this?\\nBecause you’re meant to learn to dive when you’re six.\\nYou got this, hon.\\nYou ever try focusing on your toes? My mom taught me this trick. If you pretend like there’s a string from your nose to your toes, you just kind of maintain that position. You mind doing it again? This time I’m going to shout out a tribute question. I think it’s just going to help clear your mind.\\nJust make sure it’s a question about airplanes or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\\nOkay, um, uh, what company created the Concorde?\\nA collaboration between British Airways and the French government. How’d I do?\\nYou’re good there.\\nMaybe your mom can teach him how to dive.\\nShe passed away.\\nOh, I’m so sorry.\\nYeah, sorry.\\nAll right, I’m going to go again, but this time give me one with a little shorter answer.\\nI have a better idea. You just let me do everything, I’ll guide you in. Don’t think.\\nBe careful of his shoulder.\\nYeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.\\nWouldn’t let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.\\nI had to tell her I love her. When you know she’s the one, nothing else matters.\\nI’m waving, thank you, thank you.\\nThere you go.\\nDid I do it?\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Good job, babe.\\nYour dad’s a natural.\\n[Bea] I’m so glad you guys got to spend some time with Ben.\\nAre you two really…\\n…getting to know each other in a very respectful manner? One befitting such a kind and intelligent woman as your daughter.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are in the early stages.\\nNot too early.\\n[Bea] But also not so advanced.\\nJust that magical moment when two people come together in this crazy journey we call life.\\n[Bea] That’s why I was so worried when Jonathan showed up. I don’t want to hurt his feelings.\\nI even suggested we hide our light under a bushel for his sake.\\n[Bea] But our love is just so strong. And I know what you guys are thinking. He’s much older.\\nThey weren’t, right? Probably thinking I’m 27, early 28s.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are very happy.\\nHappiest.\\n[Bea] Yep.\\nYou know, you looked like that back in the day.\\nNo, I didn’t. That guy’s made out of cobblestone.\\nThey’re holding hands.\\nI think it’s working.\\nI can’t believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.\\n[Bea] Was that bullshit about your mom?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] The story about the giant wrench. I thought it might have been a lie until all your one night nothings.\\nYou ever heard that too?\\n[Bea] Like, I didn’t mean… I’m sorry. And it wasn’t a lie.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so nice to my dad. You should probably rinse off. You have his SPF a billion on you now.\\nCheers, mate. I’ll just grab a quickie.\\nOkay.\\nSo, Australia. What do you reckon, eh? How you finding it?\\nI don’t know. It’s great.\\nMaz goes on about you all the time. Ripper Cunt, she calls you.\\nMaz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is…\\nGood friend. Oh, yeah. You know you had a proper surf when sand gets all up your clacker. And your gobbler, too.\\nGobbler is…\\nYou know, your hog bonnet. You know, your beef cap. Come on, mate. You know, the anteater. Anyway, good to have ya. Gotcha.\\nG’day, love.\\nHey, mate. Fancy a game?\\n[Bea] You’re going down. How have you been doing?\\nPretty good. You?\\n[Bea] Okay, I guess.\\nHow’s school going? Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?\\n[Bea] You know me. I’ve never been one for practicing.\\nStill having second thoughts?\\n[Bea] Straight to third.\\nI know it’s weird, me being here, but believe me, I had nothing to do with it. Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.\\n[Bea] That’s sweet. You’re part of the family.\\nI’d be lying if I said I haven’t been thinking about you.\\n[Bea] Yeah, me too.\\nHow long have you and that guy, Ben, been?\\n[Bea] It’s kind of new. Not like new, new, but newish.\\nWell, I think he seems great.\\n[Bea] No, you don’t.\\nI really don’t.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so cool about all of this. Not just this, but this too.\\nIt’s really good to see you, Bea.\\n[Bea] I’m glad you’re here. Now let’s have fun.\\nLet’s do it.\\nMate.\\nThat’s me.\\nYou want a coffee? It’s the best in the world.\\nYou guys are really proud of your coffee here.\\nIt’s the best in the fucking world.\\nOkay.\\nEnjoy.\\nFuck, that is good.\\nI was thinking of going for a bit of a run later. Do you want to join?\\nI’m actually going on a bike ride with Bea, so I don’t think I can.\\nShe’s a little sweet on you, hey?\\nOh, you caught that.\\nHow long have you and Beau been together?\\nNah, we’re just banging about. He’s nice, but I think I’m looking for someone less casual. More romantic.\\nWow.\\nWhy did me and you ever break up anyway?\\nI don’t really remember, but I think you said something like I was an immature, drongo, smothered in ex body spray.\\nSmells like you’re not that guy anymore. Bea’s a lucky girl.\\nOh.\\nHey, open the door. Bea.\\n[Bea] What’s wrong?\\nMargaret thinks we’re together.\\n[Bea] That’s great.\\nNo, Margaret needs to think we’re the right type of together. Not together together, but like situationally together. ‘Cause if she thinks we’re together together, she’s not gonna break girl code. So we need to finesse our togetherness so that we’re together, but there’s an opening for our togetherness and she can just slide right in so that we can be together.\\n[Bea] Are you on Coke?\\nNo, it’s like coffee here. It’s like meth. I’m guessing. No, I’m not. I worked at Goldman. Partner’s wedding. Do what you do.\\n[Bea] Jesus, dude, who are you?\\nI’m a man trying to figure this out. Look at your room, it’s so much bigger. You got a painting? Wow, that’s so red. We have to kick it up a notch. Make it feel like we’re in the Gaga stage.\\n[Bea] What do you wanna do, take me in the hallway?\\nThat is not Gaga. Actually, that could be construed as Gaga. Tonight’s the rehearsal dinner, so we have to do something that makes it look like you’re into me, but you’re not into me. And I’m into you, but you can tell by my face that it’s never gonna mount.\\n[Bea] Get it together, man.\\nYou hit me so much.\\n\\nOkay, Kalana, now pretend this is a real fox that messed up our garden. Fuck it up. Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up. Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up. Fuck it up. Ooh. You see that?\\nHe did it, yeah. Oh, hey, they’re here. All right, everybody, wheels up.\\nHustle up.\\nBad dog.\\nYou look cute.\\nBaby, you look so good.\\nShe’s has been.\\nYou look so good.\\nYeah, I look bad.\\nMan, this is the best time to say that.\\nDaddy’s a dad.\\nCome on, let’s go.\\nYeah.\\nAll right, let’s do it.\\nThank you.\\nYou see the size of that boat?\\nHey, guys.\\nWoo!\\n[Bea] Nice touch.\\nNice dress.\\nYou have a good heart.\\nI love this dress.\\nYou look fine.\\nOh, thank you.\\nWhat would you like to drink?\\nWhat’s a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?\\nThree scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.\\nOh, thank you.\\nAll right.\\nYou remembered.\\nThat you can’t handle hard liquor? Yeah, the smell’s still not out of my car.\\nYou know I feel really bad about that. That was a fun night. That was a fun summer.\\nMarks! Marks, captain says that we can steer the ship.\\nOh, okay, I’m coming. Hang on, I’ve got heels on.\\nLook how lucky we are. On a boat sailing back and forth with no real transportation or reason.\\nOkay.\\nAnd look at you, Polly Pocket. You the belle of the boat.\\nHe didn’t remember me.\\nOh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?\\nNo, honey, that’s, yes, I think it might be. Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.\\nThere it is.\\nWell, at least that was subtle.\\n[Bea] Was it?\\nThis oddly reminds me of prom.\\n[Bea] The first or second time?\\nJonathan is just the most perfect guy.\\nHe’s like a son to us.\\nWell, that might be a problem, mate. They might not wanna shag a brother.\\nSo how’s it going? Can parents back off a little?\\n[Bea] How about you?\\nGame on.\\n[Bea] Can you even dance?\\nYou just let me lead.\\n[Bea] Oh, God.\\nLet’s go.\\nIs Margaret watching?\\nIt’s a little hard to tell what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.\\nEverybody to the top deck, we about to do a champagne toast.\\n[Bea] Come with me.\\nSo what are we doing?\\n[Bea] Closing the deal. Titanic me.\\nWhat?\\nOh, help yourself to some champagne.\\nOh, thank you.\\nGrab some drinks.\\nOh, great.\\nNice.\\n[Bea] Titanic me.\\nNo, that is so lame.\\n[Bea] Exactly. The only people who would do something this lame are the ones who know how lame it is, but are in the first stages of liking each other, so they’re totally comfortable in their mutual lameness. Toast me.\\nOh my God.\\n[Bea] Come on.\\nThis is so cringe. So is saying cringe, old man.\\n[Bea] Lift my arms.\\nI’ve seen the movie.\\n[Bea] Have you?\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nThis is never gonna work.\\nAww! That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!\\nAre they doing Titanic?\\nAww!\\n[Bea] Are they watching?\\nYep.\\n[Bea] Are they buying it?\\nCan’t imagine they would.\\nIt’s real. We did it.\\nWe’re good. We’re really bloody good.\\nJonathan, have you seen Tasmania?\\nInya, I’m fine. It’s fine.\\nCan I do the line? That’s king of the world. You’re king of the world.\\n[Bea] Jack, I’m flying!\\nOkay, we can stop there.\\nWe can stop there.\\nThey’re gone. Show’s over.\\nOh my god!\\n[Bea] No! Wait for me! Help! Wait! Wait!\\nBae! Bea! Are you okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Why’d you jump in?\\nTo save you!\\n[Bea] But you’re a terrible swimmer!\\nI’m a great swimmer! Just short distances.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna die.\\nWe’re not gonna die.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna get hypothermia.\\nThe water’s 90 degrees.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna get eaten by sharks. Fuck! We’re gonna get eaten by sharks!\\nWe are gonna be fine. And we spent ten hours shredding water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.\\n[Bea] Goldman?\\nYeah, it was a partner’s kids bar mitzvah. A little bit of crack.\\nOh my god!\\nRoger!\\nOh my god!\\nIt looks like they’re going full Titanic. I love the commitment!\\nStop the boat!\\nNo, no, no.\\nHelp!\\nThey’re coming!\\nStay calm!\\nThis is not a very good swim.\\nBei!\\nThere.\\n[Bea] Are you sure?\\nYeah. Come on.\\nWhy aren’t we turning the boat around?\\nWe are in too shallow of water. We’ll run aground.\\nBut harbour rescue has been notified.\\nCome on.\\nAre you good?\\n[Bea] Mm-hmm.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] All right. Okay.\\nLet’s go.\\n[Bea] All right, get in the row.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] That was, um, probably the most– I mean, if you didn’t close it with Margaret, I don’t– There’s nothing more romantic than jumping in to save me.\\nYeah, well, Jonathan didn’t do it, that’s for sure. Your parents half the clock, that’s shit.\\n[Bea] You didn’t even give him a chance.\\nWhy do you keep defending this guy? Why do you break up with him in the first place?\\n[Bea] It’s complicated.\\nIt’s never complicated. What, he cheated on you? Drug problem? Did you catch him measuring his dick with a ruler app?\\n[Bea] We never fought.\\nIsn’t that a good thing?\\n[Bea] It was just comfortable. And he’s a great guy, which means there’s no one out there for me because I had the best one. I couldn’t even tell him I quit law school. And I have no idea what I’m gonna do with my life. We’re gonna get eaten by sharks, I had to tell somebody.\\nNo one else knows?\\n[Bea] I don’t think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.\\nYou finally did it.\\n[Bea] What?\\nYou know, one night you said you didn’t want to be a lawyer anyways.\\n[Bea] You remember that?\\nIt was a memorable night, until you snuck out, of course. Why did you?\\n[Bea] Because you scared the shit out of me. It was the first time in my life that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.\\nI know a little bit about that. I was really hurt when you left. So I said all that terrible stuff about you to Pete. That’s not how I felt.\\n[Bea] Look at us. Just a couple of fucked up people floating in the middle of the harbor. Promise me if we make it out alive we’ll go see that from dry land.\\nIt’s a pretty killer view from here.\\n[Bea] It’s dumb but I want to see the people. Landmarks like those are full of people in love. Marriage proposals, honeymooners, romantics jumping off of moving trains just to see the building with the person they love.\\nLike your dad in the Eiffel Tower?\\n[Bea] He told you that?\\nNothing else matters when it comes to love.\\n[Bea] You could use a bit of that right now.\\nIt’s not dumb. You, me and the opera house. It’s a date. I promise.\\n[Bea] What’s wrong?\\nI’m a little afraid of flying.\\n[Bea] Don’t you fly all the time for your job?\\nI have a very specific routine. I mask, headphones, build my bubble.\\nThat’s my Serenity song. How do you know my Serenity song?\\n[Bea] Don’t worry about it.\\n[Bea] You all good?\\nShut the fuck up now!\\nThanks again.\\nStay out of the water, yeah?\\nWant some coffee?\\n[Bea] Not the stuff from here. I’ll be up all night.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Thanks for kind of saving me though.\\nIt was fun.\\n[Bea] Stupid, but fun.\\nWell, that’s the best kind.\\n\\nNo, no, no, it’s hot!\\n[Bea] I’m warm.\\nWhen are you ever gonna learn? Like, you want me to blow on it? … Is it still hot?\\nWe’re getting pretty good at faking it.\\n[Bea] I don’t even know what’s real anymore. Everything I do just feels like a mistake.\\nBen, Steve, are you guys all right?\\nBen, wait, you hear?\\nI can’t hear you.\\nSteve!\\nBeatrice! Beatrice!\\n\\nHoney, what are these? Is that a handprint?\\nNo.\\nCome on, baby gorgeous. We got chores. Come on, let’s go. Ben, are you ready? We got groom stuff to do.\\nDude, I’m coming, I’m coming.\\nMan, I hope you scrub from top to bottom, ’cause who knows what was in that heart rate.\\nI also showered last night.\\nTwo showers in eight hours? Go off, King, get clean!\\n[Bea] Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?\\nYes, I’m so excited to marry Claudia. But, you know, I’m also hosting a party where it feels like we’re all playing parts in a play, and I’m not really into the pageantry, and I kinda just wanna do a little–\\n[Bea] All that matters is that you and Claudia run for the rest of your lives together.\\nI love you.\\n[Bea] I love you too.\\nBae? Hey, you’re still good to get the cake, right?\\n[Bea] Yes, ma’am.\\nAwesome. I put Margaret on it with you, just to be safe.\\n[Bea] Margaret.\\n\\nAll right, talk to me, baby. Who’s it gonna be, Margaret or Bae?\\nCome on, man, don’t give me that.\\nWe’re just two girls talking. I get it, though. It’s tough. Magpie’s your dream girl. She’s confident, beautiful, and she knows how to put out a fire with her attire. Now Bae’s waxing her other hand. Whoo! She’s smart, funny, quick, and she got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of.\\nPeter.\\nWhat? I’m not objectifying Margaret, man. That’d be inappropriate. That’s my cousin.\\nIt’s inappropriate with Bae too.\\nThis is deeper than I thought. Hey, Sydney! My boy is in love!\\nStop, dude, just stop.\\nWhat?\\nI know what you’re doing. I know what you’ve all been doing. You set us up, and we went along with it. But it’s fake.\\nIt was my stepdad, right? He can’t act for shit.\\nYou suck too, bro.\\nThat’s foul, dog. It’s definitely gotta be Bae, man.\\nI don’t know, man. I don’t fucking know. She doesn’t know what she wants. She’s single for basically the first time in her life. She just quit law school. Her fucking fiancé’s here.\\nMan, stop with all the white boy–\\nWhat the–\\nHey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Seriously. Anytime something gets real, you run away, call yourself a fuckboy, make an excuse, and you just move on to the next. It’s Bae. You jumped off a boat for her.\\nOh, that’s perfect.\\n[Bea] They’re gonna love it. Thank you so much.\\nLet me get this boxed up for you.\\nThank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nI don’t get all the pageantry of weddings. If you like someone, give ’em a snog. Keep it to yourselves.\\n[Bea] I wore a wedding dress for Halloween for five years in a row.\\nStop it.\\n[Bea] No, I know. It’s so pathetic. But I am with you now. This is not for me.\\nSo you and Ben aren’t serious?\\n[Bea] What? No, no, it’s just… we’re just situationally together.\\n‘Cause when I saw you last night in the harbor, I thought it might be more with you two.\\n[Bea] Just…situationally.\\nIs that an American thing?\\n[Bea] I don’t even know.\\nSo you’re right if I have a go at him, then? I feel like I might have made a mistake letting him loose. If that’s not okay, just tell me. For real.\\n[Bea] I know he really likes you.\\n\\nHow do you think I should play this with Ben? Should I wait until after the wedding?\\n[Bea] Um…I don’t know.\\nHave you guys hooked up?\\nHey.\\nWe’re Beatrice.\\nYou quit school?\\nYou’re just gonna pour gasoline on everything you’ve worked for?\\nIs there still time to re-enroll?\\nSoon as you broke up with Jonathan, everything turned to pot. Are you on drugs? Because at least then I’d understand.\\n[Bea] Who told you I quit law school? Was it Ben?\\nYou quit school?\\nWhat?\\nWhen were you gonna tell us?\\nIs this to get back at us? I’m sorry if we pushed you to succeed your whole life. We’re such awful parents.\\n[Bea] Mom, this isn’t about you.\\nYes it is. It is about us. And no, we’re not gonna let you throw away your life because you’re going through something. Everyone is always going through something. It’s called life.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] I can’t believe you. You told him I quit school?\\nNo, I didn’t.\\nYou told Pete. Pete told us.\\nShit.\\nI told you what?\\nYeah, no, I told Pete, but I didn’t mean it like that.\\nTold me what?\\nThat we’re gonna find out at some point.\\n[Bea] That’s not for you to decide.\\nI’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.\\nIt doesn’t matter how we found out.\\nFound out what?\\nShe quit law school.\\nOh, yeah, I knew that.\\n[Bea] You’re real shit.\\nI made a mistake. I’m sorry.\\n[Bea] There’s a reason why you’re alone. No one can trust you.\\nYeah, what’s your reason?\\n[Bea] Guys like you.\\nKeep telling yourself that.\\n[Bea] Fuck off.\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. Don’t do this right here, right now. I messed this all up. It’s all on me.\\nWhy don’t we all go for a swim, eh? Cool off before the wedding?\\nThat’s a great idea. Maybe early drinks?\\n[Bea] Guys, I am so sorry, but your plan is all ruined. We are not together. We were faking it the whole time.\\nYou knew?\\nWhat are they even talking about?\\nWell, we may have orchestrated a union between the pair of them in order for peace to prevail across the land.\\nYou lied to us? What have you been honest about lately?\\nSo you lied to me too? You’re not together?\\n[Bea] I could never be with someone like him.\\nYeah, ’cause I’m the one who fucked it up.\\n[Bea] You did fuck it up.\\nI fucked it up?\\n[Bea] Yeah, you fucked it up.\\nI fucked it up?\\n[Bea] You fucked it up.\\nOh, no.\\nBad dog, Kalonofin.\\nI mean, good dog, you killed that shit, but next time read the room, Kaymoney.\\n[Bea] I am so sorry.\\nHey, uh…\\nBae.\\nI think he’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine.\\n\\nGood?\\nYou’re perfect.\\nRelax, you’re working yourself up.\\nIt is not fine. It is not everything. It is fine. Okay, all we asked of them was to come out here, celebrate us, and they are ruining it.\\nAnd all week and I have been so stressed, and you’ve been more worried about what’s going on with bae than with me.\\nWell, you’ve been more concerned about your planning. Are you marrying me or your itinerary?\\nWell, if that’s how you feel, then why are we even doing this?\\nI don’t know. You tell me.\\n\\nThere’s one last thing we need to fake.\\nClaudia, Allie, we’re assholes.\\nWe’re really sorry.\\nI’m a terrible sister, and he’s a terrible friend.\\nIt’s your guys’ big day.\\nWe’re not gonna mess it up, we promise.\\nUh-huh, but just so you both know,\\nif you fuck up today, the something I borrowed\\nis a knife, and it’s shiny and new.\\nLove is intoxicating.\\nIt envelops you, it tickles you,\\nand it makes you feel like you can walk on air.\\nIt’s like this wind.\\nIt’s in your bones, it’s in your breath,\\nit’s in every beat of your heart.\\nYou can’t look for it, you can’t describe it,\\nand you can’t escape it.\\nAllie, I love you so much,\\nand I don’t think I say it enough.\\nYou are the yin to my yang,\\npeanut butter to my jelly,\\nand I will love you forever and always.\\nClaudia, I love you with so much of my heart\\nthat none is left to protest.\\nThat’s very good.\\nJust made it up.\\nA lot of it.\\nI now pronounce you married!\\nYeah!\\nOh, look, there she is.\\nOh, hey, parents.\\nIs that Tasmania?\\nYeah.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI am so sorry I lied to you guys about school.\\nI didn’t want to disappoint you guys again.\\nWell, if you’d just told us, maybe we could have–\\nTrying to talk me out of it?\\nNo, maybe we could have supported you.\\nI know this is scary for you guys.\\nYeah, it’s scary for me too,\\nand I gotta figure it out on my own.\\nI know that every now and then\\nwe might come off as a little…\\nControlling?\\nNo.\\nOverbearing?\\nNo.\\nActually crazy?\\nYes.\\nThat’s it, but only because we love you so much.\\nLove you.\\nGood luck.\\nGood luck.\\nHi, Aunt.\\nYes?\\nDo you mind if I steal a hand?\\nUh, not at all.\\nGo ahead.\\nHigh five.\\nHey.\\nHi.\\nWhere’s Bo?\\nHe buggered off.\\nHe said he saw a wave he couldn’t morally not surf.\\nI’m sorry.\\nIt was never really anything.\\nAnd you and Bea.\\nShe said you were just situational.\\nShe said that?\\nAre you good?\\nYeah, we know it’s been a tough weekend for you.\\nI don’t know.\\nThese last few days really made me realize how much I miss you.\\nWhy don’t you just go for a walk?\\nFigure your head.\\nYeah, we’ll go with you.\\nNo, we won’t.\\nNo.\\nI love you, but this is our wedding.\\nSo…\\nAre you sure?\\nYeah.\\nI might go and do some people watching.\\nJust not… these people.\\nThank you.\\nWow.\\nBen.\\nI wanted this for so long.\\nBut I think I’m just holding on to a memory.\\nAnd also, I… I’m sorry.\\nI’m so sorry.\\nI’ve never seen Bea like this before.\\nReally?\\nYou were the one who said there’s a thin line between love and hate.\\nYou’re always the first person to say that bit, you know?\\nI know it sounds crazy, but even when they were yapping at each other, I’ve never seen Bea happier.\\nSame with Ben.\\nHey, stepfather, may I have a word?\\nYes, but make it quick, son.\\nI promised my lady a dance, but don’t tell your mother.\\nYou’re so clever.\\nYou know who’s also clever?\\nBen.\\nYou know who else would be perfect for Ben?\\nThat mumbly girl who always looks like she’s got a secret.\\nYou know her name is Bea.\\nThat was a callback.\\nWill you stop?\\nStop.\\nHow you going, mate? How you going, Ben?\\nWhat, you two?\\nWhat?\\nJust enough with the loud talking and the overhearing.\\nJust stop.\\nBro, we literally didn’t know you were standing there.\\nYeah, it’s true. We didn’t know you were listening.\\nWe did.\\nIt was greatly a performance for one.\\nAnd we nailed it, too.\\nWhat is with you people?\\nThis entire weekend, I have been lied to and manipulated and puppeteered.\\nI don’t know what is real and what is not.\\nMate, I know you’re a little blurry, but I meant what I said up there about love.\\nIt’s too precious a resource to be wasted.\\nI haven’t seen her.

              " 'badland hunters': ['\\n\\nBadland Hunters\\nOriginal title: Hwang-ya\\nYear: 2024\\nRunning time: 1h 47m\\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Drama\\nDirector: Heo Myeong Haeng\\nWriters: Kim Bo-Tong, Kwak Jae-Min\\nStars: Ma Dong-seok, No Jeong-ee, Lee Joon-young\\nEvery month, like clockwork, a South Korean film or series joins Netflix’s ever-growing family, testament to the flourishing partnership between South Korea’s film industry and the streaming giant. January 26, 2024, marked the debut of Badland Hunters on the American platform. This film is actor Heo Myeong-haeng’s directorial debut, known for his roles in Old Boy and Arahan, and recently for directing The Roundup: Punishment, the fourth explosive installment of the series, set to premiere at the 74th Berlinale’s special events.\\nWritten by Kim Bo-tong and Kwak Jae-min, the story takes us to a post-apocalyptic Seoul, devastated by a catastrophic earthquake, turning the city into a wild, desolate wasteland inhabited by desperate souls and ruthless armed gangs. In this chaotic world where water is more precious than gold, a brave hunter named Nam-san (played by international star Don Lee, known for Train to Busan and as Gilgamesh in Eternals) steps up when a dear teenager is kidnapped by a deranged scientist conducting human experiments to create an immortal race, within a “condo,” the only building left standing after the disaster. The plot of Badland Hunters is pretty bare-bones, offering just what’s needed for a dystopian fantasy-action film aimed at no-frills entertainment, reminiscent of the platform’s similar venture, Black Knight, a somewhat lackluster series adaptation by Cho Ui-seok from the webtoon Delivery Knight by Lee Yun-gyun.\\n* * *\\n[whirring, beeping]\\n[somber music playing]\\n[squelching]\\n[man gasping]\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[moans]\\n[object clatters]\\nSo-yeon.\\n[gasps]\\n[device beeping]\\n[tense music playing]\\nRight.\\nSo-yeon.\\nSo-yeon.\\nI’m gonna try again.\\nI swear you’re gonna live, okay?\\n[banging at door]\\n[banging continues]\\n[banging continues]\\n[woman] Gi-su!\\n[man gasps]\\n\\n\\n\\nYang Gi-su!\\nStop right now.\\nJust let So-yeon go.\\nI have to revive her.\\nShe’ll be dead if we don’t act now.\\nDon’t make me shoot.\\nGi-su, wait.\\nYou’ve taken over a hundred lives with these horrific experiments.\\nThis isn’t what So-yeon would have wanted.\\nYour daughter’s not going to come back.

What do you think, Su-na?\\nWell, um,\\nI think I’d rather live right here with you.\\nJust because there are more people there doesn’t mean it’s safer.\\nThere was that time the cannibals tried taking us.\\nThey used to be kind before the drought, and now it’s just different.\\nYou know, not everybody in the world is evil like that.\\n[inhales deeply] Well, most people that I’ve seen are like that though.\\n[Su-na chuckles]\\nSu-na.

Nice to meet you.\\nWe actually have started a safe haven in Seoul.\\nI’m the leader of our organization’s volunteer group, and…\\n[whispers] I think that’s the same place I mentioned before.\\nBut, uh, why us though?\\nUh, you see,\\nwe’re prioritizing the safety of families with children below 20.\\nWe believe that protecting our youth is the only way to save humanity.\\nSu-na, if you come with us, your grandmother will live comfortably for the rest of her life.\\nWe have clean water and plenty of food in storage.\\nYou have clean water?\\nOh my God, that’s incredible.\\nIf that place is so amazing, then it’s gonna be a target for the gangs.\\nYou ever stop to consider that?\\n[laughs]\\nThere’s a security force of armed ex-military soldiers, which means that the gangs couldn’t possibly make a move on us.\\nWell, in that case, can the two of them come with us?\\nThey’re like family to me.\\n[Teacher] I’m sorry.\\nWe can only take direct family members right now.\\nMa’am, I’m sorry, but I need your answer soon.\\nFor Su-na’s sake,\\nI hope that you’re going to make the right choice here.\\nAnd unfortunately, we’re going to have to find someone else if you say no.\\nThe thing is, ma’am, my grandmother is not well,\\nand she won’t be able to walk that whole way.\\nWe have medical staff standing by at the halfway point to ensure everyone on our watch arrives safely. Don’t worry.\\nShe’s right. Su-na, we should go.\\nYou should go. It has to be better than this.\\nRight. You deserve that.\\nI’ll come visit you.\\n[Su-na] Okay.\\nYou too, Nam San.\\nWill you also visit us?\\nI will, I promise.\\nJust a second, Grandma.\\nThank you so much for all your help and support, Nam San.\\nDon’t mention it. Take care of yourself.\\nSafe travels.\\n[Su-na] It’s, uh, just a practice sketch.\\n[sentimental music playing]\\nOh wow!\\nWe should hurry along now. It’ll be harder to walk after sundown.\\nOh, um, Grandma, come on.\\nOkay.\\n[chuckles]\\nWhen’d she get a good-enough look to draw me like this? [chuckles]\\n[sighs]\\nHyung, Su-na has a crush on me, don’t you think?\\nHmm, nah, I don’t think so.\\nMan, what am I gonna do now that Su-na’s gone?\\nThis place is way too dangerous for her to live in.\\nThings like what happened today happen too often.\\nI mean, you could just keep her safe, like how you did today.\\n[sighs] How would I do that?\\nI couldn’t even protect my own daughter.\\nSheesh, man!\\nLook, there you go again with that kind of talk.\\n[Nam San sighs]\\n[man] But Su-na sure does look a lot like your daughter.\\nOh!\\nIf you got married and adopted me, wouldn’t that mean we could also live there?\\nHuh?\\n[sighs]\\nWhat do you think about the jewelry girl?\\nHey.\\nSeriously.\\nI know the world might have ended, but I still have standards.\\nYou just want me to be alone forever.\\n[scoffs]\\nYou know how couples take after each other?\\nYou’re pretty similar. And that complexion would look great with the right makeup.\\nHey, she stuffed that snake in her nose.\\nWho does that?\\nThat’s enough.\\nOkay? Enough.\\n[Nam San sighs wearily]\\nWhere you going?\\nUgh, you’re running your mouth too much, so I’m getting some air.\\nGoing on a night hunt?\\nThat’s right.\\nLet me come with you.\\nGrandma, are you alright?\\nUh-huh.\\nYes, dear, don’t you worry about me.\\nWatch your step here.\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[Teacher exhales]\\nOh, don’t worry. They’re part of our volunteer group.\\nOkay.\\nThese are the Western Region families joining us.\\nOh, thank you.\\nThank you for making it all the way out here, everyone.\\nIt’s a pleasure.\\nNow follow me this way, please, and be careful.\\n[woman] Um…\\nI’m Lee Ju-ye.\\nI’m 18. And you?\\nUh, Han Su-na.\\nAnd I’m also 18.\\nOh. Wanna be friends?\\nYeah, sure.\\nWe’re friends now.\\nI haven’t had a friend who’s my age in forever.\\nYeah, me too.\\nThere was nobody my age in my neighborhood either.\\nAnd where were you living?\\nI lived in a tent near the Bus District. I’ve been staying with my grandma here.\\n[grandmother chuckles]\\n[Ju-ye] Oh.\\nNice to meet you, Ju-ye.\\nMy mom and dad made us live underground ’cause it wasn’t safe outside.\\nI’m sure that was hard.\\nIt wasn’t so bad, actually.\\nBut the bugs and rats would crawl all over my body.\\nSo I had to keep moving my arms and legs, you know, so they didn’t bite down, thinking I was dead.\\nThat part was pretty rough.\\nAt least that stuff is all over now.\\n[Ju-ye] Mm-hmm. I heard the place is amazing.\\nFirst thing I’m gonna do when we get there is take a shower.\\nIt still feels like the bugs are clinging to my skin right now.\\n[wolf howls]\\n[man] I wonder if Su-na’s made it there by now.\\nGod, I wish I could go there with her.\\n[sighs] Man, I really don’t wanna have to let her go.\\nYou know we can go see her when we visit, right?\\nNo.\\nThe jewelry woman.\\nI always wanted that kind of mother.\\nAlright, you little… Come here!\\nHey, okay, I get it!\\n[Su-na] Careful.\\n[grandmother groaning]\\nOh God! Oh my…\\nOh my God! Grandma, are you okay?\\n[grandmother] Oh God.\\nLet’s stop here, okay?\\nWhy don’t we escort Su-na’s grandmother and your grandfather to the medical station I mentioned earlier on?\\nIt’s dangerous terrain from this point forward, and we wouldn’t want anyone to get hurt.\\nMr. Oh and Mr. Choi will safely escort you there.\\nThank you so much.\\nYes, thank you for everything you’re doing.\\nMa’am, just please take care of my grandma, okay?\\nOf course. We’ll take care of her.\\nMr. Choi.\\nI’ll look after your grandma.\\n[Mr. Oh] Please come with me, sir.\\n[man] Thank you so much.\\n[woman] Slowly.\\n[man] I-I’ll see you tomorrow, Dad.\\n[woman] Careful, sweetheart.\\n[man] I hope he’ll be alright.\\n[Teacher] Alright, let’s move on now, then.\\nSu-na, you just keep going. It’ll be okay.\\n[unsettling music playing]\\nOh sh… shit. Shit.\\nFreaking out again.\\nLooks like a bust.\\nLet’s check the snare.\\n[man breathing deeply]\\n[man] Okay.\\n[Nam San sighs]\\n[man exhales]\\n[sighs]\\n[unsettling music playing]\\nThese vehicles belong to us. Everyone get in, and we’ll get off our feet for the rest of the way.\\n[Su-na] Excuse me.\\nIf the cars were here, then Grandma could have just come with all of us.\\nOkay, we’ll wait, then.\\nWhat’s a few more hours of waiting when everyone’s been walking all night?\\nIsn’t that right, everyone?\\nMa.\\nHuh?\\nI’m thirsty.\\nWe don’t have any water right now.\\nHang in there, okay?\\nOh, what do we do?\\nSu-na, we’ll send a car for your grandmother tomorrow.\\nDon’t worry about her.\\nLet’s get going now.\\nGet in, everyone.\\n[woman] Oh God, thank you.\\n[Teacher] Oh my, you must be exhausted.\\nDon’t worry about your grandma too much. I’m sure she’s okay.\\n[Su-na] Mm.\\nWe need to do a head count.\\n[grandmother panting]\\n[man] To think there’s still people doing such fine work in these trying times…\\nYes, he’s right. I feel bad you’re going out of your way.\\nOh, don’t mention it.\\nAlright, it’s time to stop now.\\n[ominous music playing]\\nI don’t see the facility anywhere though.\\n[Mr. Oh] Down there.\\n[thud]\\n[gasps]\\n[man] Huh?\\nIs that Grandma?\\nGrandma!\\n[tense music playing]\\nGrandma! Wake up, Grandma!\\n[flesh stretching]\\n[yells]\\n[flesh stretching]\\nWhat’s with these freaks?\\n[panting]\\n[man] What the hell?\\nLet’s go, you asshole.\\nWhy did you kill her?\\nThey were both useless.\\nYou fucking son of a bitch!\\nOh my God…\\nSu-na…\\nWhere is Su-na?!\\n[tense music playing]\\n[gasps]\\n[man] Fucking die!\\n[yells furiously]\\n[Nam San] Ji-wan!\\nWho are you?\\n[yells]\\n[blood squelches]\\n[breathing heavily]\\nHyung, we have to go right now. Su-na’s in danger.\\nNot yet. We have to pay our respects. Are you just gonna leave her like that?\\n[Ji-wan inhales deeply]\\n[melancholy music playing]\\n[Ji-wan sniffles]\\n[sniffles]\\n[sobs]\\nWe’re almost there, everyone.\\nPlease gather your personal items.\\n[Ju-ye chuckles]\\n[metal creaking]\\nYou came here to see me?\\n[woman] That’s right.\\nI need your help, Nam San.\\nI need to rescue my associates and the residents of the apartment.\\nAll right, so my question is, why’d you come to us, of all people, for help?\\nAnd who the hell were those guys? And the apartment?\\nHey. Mind your business.\\n[grunts angrily]\\nI really need you.\\n[Nam San] I’ve never seen anything like this before.\\nYou need to chop their heads off?\\n[woman] Exactly.\\nWhat are they anyway?\\n[unsettling music playing]\\n[woman] My name is Lee Eun-ho.\\nI used to be an air force sergeant, special ops.\\nWe’re going down to look for survivors.\\n[both] Yes, Sergeant.\\n[Eun-ho] We were watching everything from the sky on the day of the great earthquake.\\nDuring our search for survivors, we came across an apartment that somehow hadn’t crumbled down.\\nSo our unit struck an aquifer there, and with the survivors, we did everything in our power to get the apartment up and running.\\nBut then one day, that man came to us.\\nYang Gi-su.\\nThe only doctor we’d seen since the tragedy.\\nBeing a doctor, he was invaluable to our cause.\\nBut one day, he showed his true colors.\\n[door opens]\\nDr. Yang, I wanted to check on something. Some parents have been complaining that their children have yet to return ever since they came to see you.\\nWhat have you done?\\n[Gi-su sighs]\\n[door opens]\\n[man] Lee Eun-ho, what’s going on?\\nWell, explain yourself.\\nSergeant Kwon, don’t you think it’s time we let Sergeant Eun-ho in on our secret?\\n[Kwon] Eun-ho,\\nthe world as we know it is doomed.\\n[ominous music playing]\\nWe need to…\\nplace all our faith in Dr. Yang.\\n[Gi-su] I merely gave him some advice.\\nI also gave him a little gift as well.\\n[menacing music playing]\\n[breathing anxiously]\\nWhy did you kill him?\\n[Kwon] Look.\\nThis is the breakthrough we were waiting for.\\n[hissing]\\n[flesh stretching]\\n[sighs]\\n[Gi-su] Sergeant Lee Eun-ho?\\nThink about it.\\nTake a good look at me.\\nHow… how do you think I was able to survive that horrible earthquake?\\nI once went two, three months or so without having any water.\\nThis is the future of mankind.\\nThis apartment won’t last long, and everyone’s doomed.\\nFailure to embrace this change will kill everyone.\\nAnd I’ll help you all survive.\\nNo, you’re insane.\\nWhere are the children?\\nGet her out.\\nWhat have you done with them?\\nNow, now.\\nWait! Let me go!\\n[Kwon] Shit!\\nLee Eun-ho!\\nIt seems Yang Gi-su has been conducting strange experiments on humans.\\nThey’ve become those creatures because of what he’s doing.\\nIf you help me, then…\\nHey.\\nListen.\\nSu-na is all I care about.\\nAnd I’m gonna kill you if you even try anything.\\nGot it?\\n[travelers gasp]\\n[Teacher] We have over 30 families living here right now, and we even provide our residents with electricity, thanks to the new solar panels that we installed.\\n[girl] Are we going to live here?\\nIs that lettuce? I even see some tomatoes.\\nWELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS\\nWELCOME TO THE NEW FUTURE OF HUMANITY\\n[Teacher] Make way, make way!\\nDr. Yang is about to come out now.\\nHello, everyone.\\nI’m in charge of this place.\\nYang Gi-su, nice to meet you.\\n[cheering]\\nWelcome, everyone.\\nYou all must have gone through terrible things out there, where the world is brutal and unsafe.\\nYou’ve all had to endure the worst out there, where the barbarians roam free.\\nBut now… now you don’t have to worry.\\nWe will be, uh, providing you with clean water and provisions, of course.\\nAnd we’ll keep you all safe from the outside world.\\nRight, get some water for them if you would.\\nThat’s clean water that we purified ourselves in this apartment.\\nYeah.\\nUh, wait, sir.\\nMy grandma is gonna be arriving soon. Can I please have another water?\\nThanks so much.\\nThey’ve been mercilessly taking children, just like they took Su-na.\\nCan you imagine what he must be doing to them?\\nThose sons of bitches! Oh shit!\\nWe have to go right now.\\nSu-na’s in danger!\\nDo you have a death wish or something?\\nCharging in won’t do us any good.\\nSecurity is much tighter than you might expect.\\nThey’ve been shooting everybody who trespasses.\\nI’ll kick things off by taking care of all the guards at the main gate and keeping them distracted come daybreak.\\nIf the two of you get to the underground prison and rescue my associates, they’ll be able to help us.\\nHey, why should we believe your associates or whatever?\\nUgh, so disrespectful, running your mouth again.\\nHow old are you?\\nI’m 18, fuck you very much, lady.\\nYou better watch your mouth.\\nLet go!\\nHey, calm down, you little lovebirds.\\nLet’s think this over.\\n[unsettling music playing]\\n[blood squelches]\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[spits]\\nAmen, yeah.\\n[indistinct yelling]\\n[cackles]\\n[man] Hey, hey!\\n[cackles]\\n[gang leader] Sir, I took care of all of them.\\n[man 1] Go at it, you stupid idiot!\\n[man 2] Fight!\\n[man 3] Hurry up and fight!\\nHey, hey!\\nCome on!\\nHey.\\n[man 5] Get ’em out of there!\\n[indistinct yelling]\\nCome on, bro.

It’s time to say your goodbyes.\\nAs we mentioned before, all the students will be living on the eighth floor.\\n[man] Huh?\\n[Su-na] What?\\nYou never mentioned that though.\\nYour grandmother has been told all of this.\\nMaybe she forgot to say something to you?\\nOh…\\nDoes that mean that I won’t live with her?\\nWill we have any contact with Ju-ye at all?\\nI’ll make sure you’ll be able to see her if you just schedule a meeting.\\nSo we just need to make an appointment with you?\\nOf course.\\n[relieved sighs]\\nI’ll get going now.

Bye.\\nThis way.\\n[Gyu-rin] Is this all I need to take?\\n[whirring]\\n[officer] This is the clean water that our children drink.\\nNow, if you look here, you’ll see the steps we take to filter the dirty water and produce the potable water we drink.\\nThe most precious resource we have.\\nHyung!\\nThey have guns here.\\nOkay.\\nHey, I’m just curious. Where’d you get the guns and the water?\\nThe apartment, is that right, guys?\\nHuh?\\n[mouths]\\nYou don’t know?\\nUh, do… do we… do… do we know where we got it?\\nWhat?\\nDo you know or not?\\nUh, I’m not… I’m not entirely sure.\\nOkay, take a nap, then.\\n[intriguing music playing]\\nDo you know?\\nI don’t exactly…\\nLights out.\\nYou?

Relax, relax.\\nThen in the Bus District, when your boys tried to nab Su-na, it was… that was for this?\\nYeah.\\nOh, you son of a bitch!\\nHey, come on, come on.\\nHow come you kids have such short tempers?\\nHey, come on.\\nLet me go.\\n[both speaking gibberish]\\nRelax, let it go.\\nWe had to make a living somehow.\\nOkay, so how did you get past their snipers, then?\\nYou can get in on…\\n[breathes deeply]\\n…delivery days. [sighs]\\nThey make sure deliveries go through.\\n[Nam San] On delivery days.\\nYou must be tired from all that talking. Get some rest.\\nWell, I feel like I’m okay, actually.\\nJust catch some Zs.\\n[mouse shrieking]\\n[Teacher] Mr. Choi has taken care of the children’s grandparents.\\nUh, our newest children are Han Su-na and Lee Ju-ye, both 18-year-old girls.\\nUh, accounting for our two new recruits, that puts us at 19 total, plus they’re much healthier than we had expected.\\nI see.\\nTake good care of those two, then.\\n[Teacher] Okay.\\nAnd make sure enough time has passed since they’ve had clean water.\\nYou know what to do.\\nI’ll make the preparations right away.\\nI’ll visit them later this afternoon.\\nAlright, get to it.\\nYou’ve got a little something there.\\n[Kwon] Let’s go.\\nHello, everyone.\\nHere, this way.\\nStand here.\\nAttention, and bow.\\nNice to meet you.\\nAlright, everybody.\\nWe have some new friends today.

And you, Su-na?\\nSu-na?\\n[chuckles] No need to be nervous.\\nYou can just say hi.\\nHi, I’m… Han Su-na.\\nI like drawing, um, and I don’t like… living with others.\\nAlright! Welcome!\\n[Ju-ye giggles]\\nThere. You can sit over there at those empty desks.\\n[Ju-ye] Okay.\\nThere you go.\\n[Ju-ye] Hello!\\n[Teacher] Alright. Today, we’ll learn why we need to change our metabolism.\\nOpen your books, everyone.\\nLet’s first talk about the anatomy of humans as things stand.\\nBecause we currently need to drink water and consume food in order to survive, we’ve wasted precious resources on people that do not serve the greater cause.\\nTo be frank, we are weak, and in our current world, which is plagued by a shortage of water, mankind needs to take a new, stronger physical form.\\nWe must develop a new metabolic system in order to breed humans that can survive for extended periods of dehydration and malnutrition, thereby reversing the population decline and paving the way for civilization to be reborn.\\nChildren, in this harsh and unforgiving world, always remind yourselves of Dr. Yang Gi-su’s miracle and of your own responsibilities.\\nOur metabolism will improve through Dr. Yang’s research, and eventually, mankind will finally be given a body which can adapt to this brave new world.\\nPay attention, Su-na.\\nIt’s just odd.\\nNobody even has enough to drink on the outside, yet the people here are able to drink however much they want and even shower.\\nEveryone keeps going on and on about Dr. Yang Gi-su.\\nShouldn’t he be giving water to everybody out there who needs it?\\n[unsettling music playing]\\nOh, Su-na.\\nThe outside world is full of barbarians.\\nThe exact same type that killed Yang Gi-su’s beloved daughter.\\nIn order to join the new humanity,\\nyou need to be the right kind of person.\\nWhat kind… what kind of person is that?\\n[Ju-ye] People that offer aid in furthering the doctor’s research.\\nI wanna be a part of the research support.\\nWell, you sound like you have the right attitude, Ju-ye, no?\\nSu-na sure could learn a lot from you.\\n[Ju-ye] Yes, ma’am.\\n[Teacher] Now, then, for our next lesson, we’ll be learning about organisms that are best at surviving in the wild.\\nWe’ll be getting a visit from Dr. Yang Gi-su later, so let’s all welcome him properly to show our gratitude.\\n[all] Yes.\\n[exhales]\\n[Teacher] These rations are the fruits of your parents’ hard work, as I’m sure you’re all aware.\\nLet us all dig in with a thankful heart.\\nAnd there’s the water, which is more valuable than anything else in this world.\\nMake sure to drink it all down to the very last drop.\\nDr. Yang Gi-su had it specially purified for all of you here.\\nJu-ye.\\n[Gi-su] Hello, everyone.\\n[Teacher] Alright, a round of applause, everyone.\\nAttention.\\nBow.\\n“Students are our hope.”\\nI’m sure you’re all aware of our apartment’s motto, right?\\nThat’s the reason we’ve been supplying our students with a special diet.\\n[inhales] The world is beset by a shortage of food and water, as you know.\\nI’m working day and night to create a new world where humans are going to be able to survive and live a good life with only a minuscule amount of food and drinking water.\\nBut until that day comes, you all need to finish everything you’re given, making sure not to waste any.\\nYes.\\nAlright.\\nDoctor, we have someone very promising.\\nOh, there.\\nMm-hmm. She’s wonderful.\\nHer name?\\n[Teacher] Lee Ju-ye.\\n[Gi-su] Lee Ju-ye, right?\\nYes.\\nHi. You’re 18?\\nYeah!\\nI heard you really wanted to help me with my research.\\n[Ju-ye] Mm.\\nWhy don’t we get the ball rolling with a consultation?\\n[Teacher] Yes, of course.\\nUh-huh.\\nWell, uh, why don’t we have you eat first?\\nUh, I’ll send someone over to meet you in three hours, huh? And then we can get started.\\nOh wow! Thank you, Doctor. [giggles]\\n[Gi-su] Right.\\nLet’s go.\\nDr. Yang.\\nWhere’s my grandmother? Did she get here safe?\\nOf course she did. Don’t you worry.\\nIf my grandmother’s here, I wanna see her.\\n[Gi-su exhales in annoyance]\\nExcuse me.\\nDid you explain everything to her?\\n[gasps]\\nI’m so sorry.\\n[unsettling music playing]\\nSu-na.\\nUh, your grandmother is much worse than we expected, so we’ll have to keep her in treatment for the next two to three days.\\nGrandma got that sick on the way here?\\n[chuckles nervously]\\nShe just needs to rest, okay?\\nYou’re going to be able to see her in a day or so.\\nDr. Yang Gi-su himself is personally seeing to her treatment…\\nYes, of course. Now,\\nI have been overseeing her care, so don’t worry, okay?\\nShe’s going to be much better soon, and…\\nOh, Su-na.\\nSu-na, you’re terribly malnourished right now. Huh?\\nSo drink some water.\\nYou’ll regain your health. Here.\\nHmm?\\nAlright, then. Enjoy your dinners, and don’t forget,\\nyou are our future!\\n[unsettling music building]\\n[music fades]\\n[groaning weakly]\\n[exhales forcefully]\\nAlright, clean things up here.\\n[woman] Yes, sir.\\nIt’s been over 20 hours, and Sergeant Choi and Sergeant Oh haven’t returned.\\nThings could get bad for them if they don’t make it in time.\\n[Gi-su] They should be okay.\\nMaybe we should hand out personal doses in case of situations like this.\\n[sighs]\\nIt’s still too dangerous for people to carry.\\nBesides, there’s no telling what kind of side effects we’ll see going forward.\\nHow long are we going to have to keep injecting?\\nWe’re starting to run out of children to bring to the apartment.\\nWe’re gonna get there.\\nJust be patient.\\n[Kwon exhales]\\nGet back to work.\\nThey only care about themselves.\\nDignity for humans?\\nLong gone.\\n[breathes deeply]\\nThis research needs to come to fruition, right?\\nIf we want a meaningful life… it’ll only be when… when they realize the sacrifices of these evolutionary rejects was necessary for survival.\\nThat day will come, don’t you think?\\n[grunts]\\n[sighs]\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[lock clicks]\\n[music fades]\\nTime for a shift change.\\n[indistinct chatter]\\nExcuse me. Excuse me.\\n[chuckles]\\nUh, we, uh, signed up to see our child earlier on.\\nWhen will we be able to go see her?\\nA meeting? What do you mean, meeting?\\nThe teacher said that after we finish our work for the day,\\nwe could sign up to visit our daughter.\\nUh, there’s, um…\\nWe don’t have that policy.\\nShe definitely told us that earlier on.\\nWe’re happy to go to the eighth floor if Ju-ye can’t come down.\\nThe eighth floor is especially off-limits to regular residents.\\nUh, well, where’s the teacher, then?\\n[sighs] You know what? Where’s our daughter?\\nWhat the hell do you mean we can’t go see our child?\\nThis is ridiculous!\\n[man] They’re stopping them seeing their child.\\n[woman] I hope our kids are okay.\\nDon’t mind us and change shifts, everyone.\\nWe’ll talk about this tomorrow.\\nWait, wait, wait.

Their passion cools overnight, however, leaving Bea heartbroken and fuming after overhearing Ben\\u2019s dismissive remarks to a friend. Years later, fate throws them together at a luxurious Australian wedding, forcing them to share space and endure awkward family gatherings \\u2013 not helped by the presence of Bea\\u2019s persistent ex-fianc\\u00e9 and Ben\\u2019s jealous ex-girlfriend.\\nIn an attempt to ease the tension and ensure a smooth celebration, the wedding party hatches a mischievous plan: convince everyone Bea and Ben are a happy couple. Despite initial resistance, fuelled by personal motives, both agree to the charade. Bea seeks escape from her ex\\u2019s shadow, while Ben hopes to spark jealousy in his old flame.\\nAs they navigate the masquerade, participating in romantic couple activities and faking intimate moments, something unexpected happens. The line between pretense and reality blurs. Underneath the bickering and witty banter, they discover unexpected vulnerabilities and shared passions, leading to a genuine connection they can\\u2019t ignore.\\nTheir budding romance faces obstacles: Jonathan\\u2019s disapproval, Bea\\u2019s overbearing parents, and the inevitable exposure of their charade. But through humorous confrontations and self-reflection, they learn to trust each other and fight for their newfound love. In the end, defying expectations and overcoming external pressures, Ben and Bea choose to embrace their feelings, leaving the future open to exciting possibilities.\\nTheir journey is not just about finding love, but also about self-discovery. Bea sheds her insecurities and carves her own path, while Ben confronts his emotional walls and learns to be vulnerable. Their relationship, born from a playful ruse, blossoms into something authentic and true, reminding us that love can sometimes surprise us in the most unexpected places.\\n\\n* * *\\n[Bea] Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.\\n[Bea] Hi. Where\\u2019s your bathroom?\\nIt\\u2019s for customers only.\\n[Bea] Oh, okay. I\\u2019ll buy something.\\nYou gotta pay up there.\\n[Bea] Can I just go now? I really have to pee.\\nI\\u2019ve got a large cappuccino for Skylar.\\nThanks.\\n[Bea] I also kind of, well, no\\u2026 I know that establishments that serve food or drink must be open to the public regardless of their purchasing class.\\nSorry, it\\u2019s our policy.\\n[Bea] Store policy can\\u2019t really supersede state law. Please, it\\u2019s an emergency.\\nCaramel latte for Miranda.\\nHoney, I\\u2019m about to order. Do you want your usual?\\n[Bea] Uh.\\nMy wife would like a double espresso although you\\u2019ve had trouble sleeping lately, right babe? Maybe we should back it off to a single. You kept the light on until like midnight last night.\\n[Bea] I did, didn\\u2019t I? Yeah, so maybe I\\u2019ll just have a peppermint tea with two sugars. Thanks, husband.\\nOh, and the bread. It\\u2019s grilled cheese night. And she is part of the purchasing class, so can we get the bathroom key? Thank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you. That was really nice.\\nHappy to. You knew a lot about bathroom law.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] It was a short chapter. Thank you.\\nOh. I\\u2019ll have your tea waiting for you. Can\\u2019t leave my wife.\\n[Bea] Oh. Okay. That\\u2019s great. I will see you on the other side.\\n\\n[Bea] Hallie, I just met this guy and I don\\u2019t know, it was something. Well, I know it\\u2019s been a while, but I\\u2019m pretty sure he bought me a tea and he might have just stolen my coat. But what do I do? Oh no, this is the time that I\\u2019m supposed to be meeting people and doing things. Hallie, I gotta call you back. God damn it.\\nAre you okay?\\n[Bea] Big time. I am big time okay. I just had to pee for like the last six hours and I just started this new internship. And I didn\\u2019t want to ask anyone where the bathroom was because I didn\\u2019t want them to think I was weak and not a problem solver.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. Every human does it. It\\u2019s very, very normal.\\nYeah.\\nPeppermint tea, two sugars.\\n[Bea] Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Hi.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nOh, hey. You\\u2026\\n[Bea] So are you going to ask me out now?\\nYeah. Yeah, I am. I\\u2019m Ben.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m Bea.\\n[Bea] So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, you would not be able to protect us?\\nNo, no. You\\u2019d be dead.\\n[Bea] You would let me die?\\nI\\u2019m not going to let you die. I\\u2019m just going to survive. You\\u2019re right. You\\u2019re right. You\\u2019re right.\\n[Bea] I was a gymnast.\\nGymnast?\\n[Bea] Yes. For like five years. I got like sixth place on beam.\\n\\n\\n\\nSixth place?\\n[Bea] Yes. Got a ribbon.\\nI\\u2019m impressed.\\n[Bea] Everybody gets a ribbon.\\nAll right, wait to cool down. You just saw me take it off the burning stove.\\n[Bea] Oh, my God.\\nIf you\\u2019re going to be a lawyer, you got to understand negligence and breach and McDonald\\u2019s versus that lady\\u2019s habeas corpus.\\n[Bea] You used none of those terms properly.\\nHow do you know? You\\u2019re not a lawyer yet. It\\u2019s not too late to choose a more noble profession.\\n[Bea] Oh, like you?\\nYou\\u2019re right. Stick with it. I\\u2019m going to need a lawyer at some point.\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t even know if I want to be a lawyer. I cannot believe I just said that out loud. I\\u2019m sorry. My life is a disaster right now.\\nMight be turning the corner. You just met me.\\n[Bea] Or I might end up in a suitcase. I mean, look at this place. It looks like every serial killer reenactment documentary. Why do you have a giant wrench?\\nOkay, it wouldn\\u2019t be a suitcase. It\\u2019d be a carry-on because you\\u2019re zero feet tall. And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how broken something is, there\\u2019s always a way to fix it. I\\u2019m sorry. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m talking to you about my mom right now.\\n[Bea] Alright. Then tell me about that.\\nThat is a long story. Everybody survived.\\n[Bea] Great.\\n[Bea] Holly, I don\\u2019t know this guy. He\\u2019s fucking great.\\nYo, let\\u2019s go, Benny. Come on, cupcake. We\\u2019re gonna be late.\\n\\u2018Sup, Pete.\\nNo way. You cooked? That girl you blew me off for stayed over?\\n[Bea] He asked me out and then I kind of asked him out and then we just walked around the city and we fell asleep talking. I don\\u2019t\\u2013 I left before you could wake up. I don\\u2019t know why. Why did I? What the fuck am I doing? Okay, I love you. Bye. I\\u2019m so sorry I woke you up. I didn\\u2019t\\u2013 This whole thing is so new to me. Bye.\\nYou got cheese and bread. You didn\\u2019t miss one ingredient. What you doing with that? Why you got the giant wrench? You told her about your mom, bro? You don\\u2019t tell nobody about your mom. Fuck, dog. You in love, man. About fucking time, man. My boy\\u2019s in love.\\nFuck that. I couldn\\u2019t get her out of here fast enough. This girl\\u2019s a disaster. She\\u2019s a nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIX MONTHS LATER\\nWant to get a mansion, a jacuzzi, a theater to watch my movies, a couple whips and lots of fancy things.\\nThe kids, they call the goonies.\\nI see the future crystal ball, mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall.\\nGot your girlfriend screaming all the cops.\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nClaudia.\\nHolly.\\nThere we go.\\nHey, what\\u2019s up, Glee?\\nBen, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.\\nAre we saying that now?\\nYeah, is that cool?\\nYeah, I mean, I don\\u2019t really like labels, but I like you a whole bunch. I like your friend a whole bunch. And if she wants to put a label on me, then she can sew it on wherever she wants. That was weird. That was weird. I\\u2019m not into S&M or anything like that, unless you are, which would be totally cool, you know? You do you.\\nWell, she really likes you, too. And that is very rare for her.\\nOh, look who\\u2019s talking.\\nHow\\u2019s the crowd in here tonight?\\nOver there, big boy.\\nOh, B.\\nDo ladies like dumplings? We just had the greatest dumplings.\\nPete, meet my sister. This is Pete, Claudia\\u2019s brother.\\n[Bea] Nice to meet you.\\nAnd Ben. Ben. This is Ben. We all grew up together.\\nHey.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nYou two know each other?\\nYeah, we met.\\n[Bea] Barely.\\nWow, that\\u2019s so random.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m going to go grab a drink.\\nDoor\\u2019s that way if you\\u2019re looking to sneak out. I know that\\u2019s your thing.\\n[Bea] Well, I am a disaster.\\nLet\\u2019s go away from this.\\nYeah.\\nSo you a lawyer yet?\\n[Bea] Why? Do you need a defense attorney?\\nI\\u2019m just curious how you passed the class on ethics and not bailing on people.\\nI think that\\u2019s the jerk who B got with when she was on her break from Jonathan.\\nNo way. So B\\u2019s the coffee girl who ghosted him?\\nI thought she looked familiar, but I don\\u2019t see faces. I just see souls.\\nAt least he made her realize that Jonathan was the one.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m engaged now.\\nGood for you. Where are you registered? I\\u2019ll buy you a broomstick.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019ll send you an invite. You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?\\nYou do remember. See, it did mean something to you.\\n[Bea] You\\u2019ll always be my rock bottom. The night I spent with a bitch.\\nDid she just call him a bitch?\\nYou think they\\u2019re going to physically fight?\\nOr fuck?\\nThat\\u2019s a fine line.\\n[Bea] Let\\u2019s just get through tonight for them, OK?\\nElle, she\\u2019s your sister. I\\u2019m sure the relationship won\\u2019t last long.\\n[Bea] She\\u2019s your friend. I question why they\\u2019re even together.\\nThen I\\u2019m going to get a drink and toast to never seeing you again.\\n[Bea] Cheers to that, bro.\\n\\nANYONE BUT YOU\\nSo before I pronounce this newlywed couple, if anyone has an issue with these two wonderful people joining together in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.\\nI have an objection.\\nLeo, don\\u2019t do this.\\nI have to, Annie. It\\u2019s just not right. There\\u2019s no way I can bless this union without their friends and family joining us to celebrate in Australia.\\nWe\\u2019re getting married in Sydney.\\n\\nWelcome on board. 2K to the front.\\nThank you, Sheryl.\\n51E, how long\\u2019s the flight?\\n16 hours. 51F, thanks. 73F, all the way to the back.\\nHey. Head of the wedding?\\n[Bea] Of my sister, yes, I am.\\nHow crazy is it that we\\u2019re on the same plane?\\n[Bea] Don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s thousands of flights flying to Sydney every day.\\nOh, there\\u2019s quite a few, actually. Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, some co-chairs. Serendipity, I guess.\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t think that word means what you think it means.\\nSo where\\u2019s your fiance? Wait, is this him? Hey, I\\u2019m Ben. I was her hall pass on your break.\\nWhat?\\nOh my god, I forgot. Claude told me you dumped him. Did you sneak out on your wedding day?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Wow, you are a child.\\nIt\\u2019s a pretty long flight. Do you want anything from the front of the boat? Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?\\n[Bea] No, thank you. I\\u2019m all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.\\nNothing small about me.\\nWhat the fuck?\\nHave a good flight. See you there.\\n\\nWhy do so many of us feel stuck? How is it even a very successful? Often feel like there is something missing from their lives. Why do so many people spend years mystically thinking about choices they might have made? One answer to that problem, many of us are leading lives that are misaligned with our own deepest values and preferences.\\nThank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain. What psychology can teach us about living our most authentic lives?\\n[Bea] What the fuck?\\n\\nHey, Vinny! Vindale! OK, Vin, looking good.\\nThanks for picking me up, dude.\\nNot just you, my guy.\\nSpelling Bee!\\n[Bea] Hey!\\nOur sisters are getting married. How dope is that?\\n[Bea] I know, I\\u2019m so excited.\\nOh, great. All right, let\\u2019s hit it.\\nThank you. I hope all of you have a wonderful vacation. I wish you all the best for the Mid-Autumn Festival.\\nBye.\\nY\\u2019all ready for Australia?\\nCan\\u2019t wait for y\\u2019all to see where we stay. And the plan is so dope.\\nWe\\u2019re all staying at the same place?\\nYep, my stepdad\\u2019s house. Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.\\n[Bea] Sounds like a piece of information that could have been shared a little earlier.\\nWell, that\\u2019s because they think you guys hate each other, so they didn\\u2019t want to poke the beard.\\n\\nNot bad, right?\\nYou don\\u2019t even play tennis.\\nI know, but I feel sweet.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee, y\\u2019all.\\nMeet Kalonabee.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee.\\nAll over.\\nAll over.\\nSpin, spin, spin.\\nWoo-hoo!\\nHe was the only member of the family who was trans.\\nYeah, he was there.\\n[Bea] Whoa.\\nYou\\u2019re right. This place is insane.\\nI know. All right, let\\u2019s get some sand under your feet.\\nHave you guys made up?\\nAll good.\\n[Bea] We\\u2019re fine if he just stays away from me.\\nDon\\u2019t need an invitation for that.\\n[Bea] I think you do if you\\u2019re like this. You can\\u2019t leave me alone.\\nSame reason I slowed down at the car crash.\\nOkay, so you guys buried the hatchet, water under the bridge, two adults adulting like fucking adults.\\nOh, we did have a little bit of a last minute snafu though. You guys are gonna have to share a room. There\\u2019s only one bed, but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.\\nShe\\u2019s kidding.\\n[Bea] You\\u2019re funny. I can\\u2019t wait any longer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWait for me!\\nHallie\\u2019s such a goof.\\nShe\\u2019s good for you. She could use some spontaneity.\\nHey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.\\nI hope so. I have a million contingencies and scenarios for everything. And honestly, I just want this wedding to be beautiful because I love the shit out of her and I just wanna marry the bitch, you know what I\\u2019m saying?\\nYou\\u2019re such a romantic.\\nHey, don\\u2019t be mad at me, but Margaret\\u2019s here.\\nWhy would I be mad? She lives here, I was 100% expecting to see her.\\nYeah. Margaret, Margaret, look who\\u2019s here.\\nThere she is. 100%.\\nGo rip off the band-aid.\\nBabe!\\nHow\\u2019s it going, stranger?\\nI was hoping you\\u2019d come. I wanted to message you, but I didn\\u2019t know how you\\u2019d feel about hearing from me.\\nAre you kidding?\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m never leaving.\\nNever leave.\\n[Bea] How are mom and dad?\\nThey\\u2019re good. You know, mom now thinks she\\u2019s Australian and dad\\u2019s not at all pointing out every tiny little detail that\\u2019s different. They\\u2019re also a little worried how you\\u2019re gonna react to all this.\\n[Bea] What are you talking about?\\nWell, you know, everybody thought that you\\u2019d be the one getting married first. You always used to talk about your wedding growing up. You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress when I just used it to dress like a mummy, you know?\\n[Bea] Hallie, stop. That\\u2019s not me anymore. I\\u2019m free now. I\\u2019m deprogrammed. That does not mean I don\\u2019t support you and your misguided view that soulmates exist.\\nThat\\u2019s sweet. Is that gonna be your toast?\\n[Bea] You and Claudia are the exception. I\\u2019m really happy for you, for real. What\\u2019s going on over there?\\nThat\\u2019s Claudia\\u2019s cousin. She visited the States a few years back. They dated. No biggie. Broke up with him. Crushed his heart.\\nNo way, that man does not have a heart.\\nFeels like forever ago. We were babies.\\nI\\u2019m really happy you\\u2019re here. We can reconnect as maybe not babies.\\nI would love that. Beau! Come eat my mate. Ben, this is my partner, Beau.\\nHi, mate.\\nLike, tennis partner?\\nSometimes after. How do you two dags know each other?\\nWe had a bit of a go back when, didn\\u2019t we?\\nDid you now? Good on ya. Hey, we\\u2019re gonna go trotting this weekend. Hit up the turps out here, eh? It\\u2019s gonna be a cracker. Woo!\\nYou know it.\\nGreat guy.\\nYeah.\\n\\nMommy!\\nHey, Beatrice.\\n[Bea] Dad!\\nYou made it.\\nOh, baby.\\nHi, baby.\\nHi, honey.\\nOh, my God.\\nWow.\\nHow\\u2019s our future lawyer?\\n[Bea] Great.\\nGreat.\\n[Bea] How\\u2019s the trip been?\\nOh, magical. The Australians are all wonderful. And excuse me, but good looking.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nWhy are they so weird about their plugs? I mean, this place is basically America. They speak English, they eat regular food, they have a complicated relationship with their past.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI\\u2019m doing okay.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m doing great. My big sister\\u2019s getting married.\\nCould have been you. Could still be you someday.\\nHave you heard from Jonathan? Did he call or anything?\\nWell, that didn\\u2019t take long.\\nWe\\u2019re just torn up that he\\u2019s not part of our family anymore.\\nI mean, he works at our house every night from like 11 years old. He was basically family. Was about to be actual family.\\n[Bea] If I never ask you for anything ever again, can you please just lay off of me this weekend?\\nI just want both of our daughters to be happy.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m very happy, but not when you guys do this.\\nNed, you in the right direction? He\\u2019s such a great guy. Just think on it, yeah?\\n\\nBee, dinner at 7.30, okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Yeah.\\nBen, all set for dinner, yeah?\\nYeah, I\\u2019ll be there.\\n\\nI was plagiarizing.\\nHey!\\nHi Ben!\\nHey Ben!\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nEverybody?\\nDad\\u2019s speech.\\nOh yes, right, okay. We\\u2019re gonna make this short, because you\\u2019ve all traveled a bloody long distance, and Carol and I are so appreciative. Biggest thing we\\u2019ve missed since coming back from the States is not seeing our kids. And you lot, our extended family, so we\\u2019re just over the moon to have a full house before the wedding on Sunday.\\nWhere we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia, setting off on this crazy thing called life. And of course, Innie and Leo, our new family.\\nWell, we\\u2019re just so grateful, not only for your incredible hospitality, but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.\\nSo as they say in our country, abondanza.\\nCheers!\\nNow baby.\\nWow!\\nWhat classes are you loving? Have you given any more thought to tort law? \\u2018Cause class action is really where it\\u2019s at right now. What does Jonathan say? He knows you pretty well. What does he think you should do?\\n[Bea] Mom.\\nOkay.\\nI can\\u2019t even remember why we put you in the truck again. We didn\\u2019t put her in the trunk, she stowed away in the trunk.\\nYeah, I wanted to go with you guys to see Cinderella.\\nWe were going to Coachella.\\nI know that now, it was nice.\\nAll right, everyone. So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy. Let\\u2019s just have a moment to calm ourselves. I am not looking at anybody in particular, but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.\\nCrown chakra.\\nLet\\u2019s hit that cobra.\\nCleanse, get that weasel.\\nOkay.\\nGo!\\nYou go, you go.\\nSign of the times.\\nAll right, all right, four words.\\nFirst word, the, A, of, if.\\nAnimosity, hate, liar.\\nFive words.\\n[Bea] No, just shut the fuck up.\\nThe Bible.\\nA woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality to take advantage of other people.\\nMom, focus, okay? Right here, right here.\\nThis is a white people\\u2019s game. Y\\u2019all spend so much time trying to trick each other. Y\\u2019all got so much time on your hands. Just say the word.\\nIt\\u2019s on the extreme.\\nGrumpy old man.\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nOkay, okay, yeah, okay.\\n[Bea] Fuck boy.\\nOld cat woman.\\n[Bea] Your ego.\\nOkay.\\nWhat is this?\\n[Bea] Wait, no props.\\nNo one cares, no one can see us.\\n[Bea] Cheaters are shocking.\\nSays the woman who cheated on her fiance.\\n[Bea] We were on a break, asshole.\\nYou\\u2019re either broken up for good, or you\\u2019re cheating. Either way, someone\\u2019s lying to someone.\\n[Bea] I must have really gotten under your skin.\\nRoger, what is this?\\nFat, five.\\nWhat is the thing I\\u2019m holding in my hand?\\nFireworks.\\nFireworks by Katy Perry.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] That is not fair.\\nHey, what, you\\u2019re not fair. What\\u2019s wrong with you? Just stop.\\n[Bea] What are you doing?\\nWhat is wrong with you?\\n[Bea] Stop.\\nOh God.\\nOh God.\\nSam, what the?\\nOh my God.\\nAli.\\nGet back.\\nSam.\\nRoger.\\nI\\u2019ve got this.\\nThat\\u2019s some gangster shit right there.\\nSorry.\\n[Bea] Sorry.\\n\\nThey\\u2019re going to ruin our wedding.\\nAll that matters is that we\\u2019re together.\\nIt\\u2019s true.\\nLook baby, I love you to the moon and back, but those two fuckwads are going to destroy our weekend, and our memories, which we are going to have for a very long time, are headed straight over a cliff.\\nIt\\u2019s going to be fine baby, we just have to. to stand there and profess our love.\\nIt seems to me, their animus only surfaced after they spent a night together. Am I accurate?\\nThat\\u2019s usually how it goes, honey.\\nWe crumple our feelings into a ball and shove \\u2019em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.\\nThe solution appears to be simple then. We return them to the night they were spent.\\nLike we trick them into falling in love with each other?\\nHe didn\\u2019t say anything about love, honey. We just need to get them to jump each other\\u2019s bones.\\n\\nYeah, come on!\\nThat was good, right?\\nThat was good.\\nYou go, you go, you go, you go, you go.\\nShe clearly has eyes for Ben.\\nWho does, father?\\nHallie Spence, the sister. The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.\\nYou can\\u2019t say that. What the hell?\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that was rude. I apologize to anyone that was listening, which can only be you, Pete, \\u2019cause you\\u2019re the only person that was listening. I apologize.\\nI accept your apology and will now move on. Do you know Bea\\u2019s been in love with Ben since the first night they met?\\nWell, why didn\\u2019t she tell him? You know, when I was a young bloke and I liked a girl, I would sneak up behind her and I\\u2019d cut a lock of her hair and then I\\u2019d smack her on the bum!\\nWhat the hell?\\nI don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019m not good at this, sorry.\\nBea was just too scared to tell him, but I\\u2019ve talked to her and she says she regrets walking out that morning.\\nTell me more, son.\\nWhy me?\\nBecause you\\u2019re really good at it, right? You can do it.\\nWhy me, why? Why you put this hat on me? No one can see me, it\\u2019s a radio play, motherfucker. Bea wants us to tell him how much she likes him, so he lets his guard down and goes to her. Some Cupid\\u2019s killed with arrows and some with traps.\\nThat was good, I like that, that\\u2019s good.\\nI just made it up.\\nSo, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers, and say, \\u201cCome to Papa.\\u201d\\nWhat are you doing?\\nI\\u2019m from a different generation.\\nAnd your generation sucks. You fucked up the whole world for us.\\nAnd I\\u2019m full of shame. But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.\\nBut Ben feels awful that he called her a disaster. I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.\\nThen why is he fighting with her?\\nWell, because he likes her.\\nAnd I know that Bea likes Ben. She\\u2019s just denying herself because she\\u2019s got in her head somehow that she\\u2019ll never love again.\\nWhoa, I\\u2019m not talking about love, baby. I\\u2019m talking about dick.\\nOh, it\\u2019s Ben.\\nOh.\\nHey. You.\\n[Bea] Oh God, they got to you too?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia say how much I like you?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really?\\nIt was Pete and Roger.\\n[Bea] Fantastic, it\\u2019s a team effort. They\\u2019re trying to get us together.\\nNo way.\\n[Bea] Come here.\\nOh, maybe they want us to stop acting like assholes so we don\\u2019t ruin the biggest event of their lives.\\n[Bea] Us? There is no us and assholes. You\\u2019re the one who destroyed the living room.\\nWould you two mind helping me with something? I hate to ask, but I\\u2019d really appreciate it.\\nSure.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\n\\nSo Roger left his sunglasses on the sailboat. I swear, if his head wasn\\u2019t screwed on, we\\u2019d use it as a bowling ball. Do me a favor and swim out and get them. It\\u2019s the one on the right.\\nBoth of us.\\n[Bea] Is that really a two person job?\\nDoesn\\u2019t seem like it.\\nYou two. Yeah.\\n[Bea] All right, so everyone\\u2019s involved in this.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] I feel bad.\\nMe too.\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t want to bum Holly and Claudia out.\\nJust me and you.\\n[Bea] Can you not swim?\\nI\\u2019m an excellent swimmer.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of breath?\\nI\\u2019m fine. How much further do you think?\\n[Bea] Are your eyes closed?\\nI think it\\u2019s dark.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of shape? You have like a 10 pop.\\nI\\u2019m not out of shape. I\\u2019ve been to 295, 300 once. I just don\\u2019t do cardio.\\n[Bea] Oh my God, you\\u2019re hot girl fit.\\nI\\u2019m not hot girl fit.\\n[Bea] Okay, my bad. We\\u2019ll see you at the boat.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nI could have done it myself, but whatever. Thanks.\\n[Bea] No fucking way.\\nHoney, look who\\u2019s here.\\n[Bea] I cannot believe they did this.\\nWho is that?\\n[Bea] That is my ex, Jonathan.\\nHey, hey.\\nWhat is he doing here?\\n[Bea] My Black Hawk helicopter parents have been trying to get us back together for the past four months.\\nThey flew him halfway across the world to your sister\\u2019s wedding? That\\u2019s some deep off shit. They came to play.\\n[Bea] That\\u2019s my parents. They think I\\u2019m throwing my life away.\\nHoney, we\\u2019re just gonna take him back and get him all settled in.\\nI\\u2019ll see you later.\\n[Bea] You know, maybe we should do it. Just tell everyone we\\u2019re together.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] It would solve that problem for me and that problem for you.\\nI don\\u2019t have a problem.\\n[Bea] You clearly want Margaret.\\nNo, I don\\u2019t.\\n[Bea] Yes, you do. I saw the way you looked at her last night and I know she broke your heart. She sees you\\u2019re with me. She wants what she can\\u2019t have and then bye bye crocodile Jack. Fuck, he\\u2019s fast.\\nMaking her jealous is not gonna work. We\\u2019re not in seventh grade.\\n[Bea] Trust me, bro. We\\u2019re all in seventh grade when it comes to this stuff. They\\u2019ve already gone through all of the bullshit trying to trick us into each other\\u2019s arms. Let\\u2019s just embrace it.\\nThere\\u2019s no way we can convince anyone we actually like each other.\\n[Bea] Yeah, you\\u2019re right.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] You know, I still think about that night we spent together.\\nShut up.\\n[Bea] No, I\\u2019m serious. You know, this could be kind of fun. We\\u2019re at a wedding a million miles away from home. Who knows what could happen under the cover of a masquerade. And that night at your place, no matter how it ended, it was still pretty amazing. \\u2026 Convincing enough?\\nFuck it. Let\\u2019s do it. \\u2026 Just wait. Wait.\\nOkay, okay. Whoever wants to go on the hike, we need to leave now. We\\u2019re running behind schedule.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nBabe, the mountains have been there for millions of years. A few more minutes isn\\u2019t gonna hurt them.\\nBaby, I know you are trying to calm me down and I love you for it. Thank you. But I am hurting cats right now and I need some help instead of this easy breezy Martin Scorsese.\\nAw, jitters. Remember our wedding?\\nOnly that you\\u2019re the most beautiful bride on God\\u2019s green earth.\\nRight answer.\\nWe\\u2019re coming, we\\u2019re coming, we\\u2019re coming.\\nJinx, you owe me a cup.\\nOh, you have a little something in your teeth.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.\\nYeah, let me just take that out.\\nOh, I gotta get it out.\\nOh, it\\u2019s right there.\\nGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.\\nHoney, here he is.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] Jonathan.\\nSo nice to see you.\\n[Bea] I had no idea you were coming.\\nSo your parents didn\\u2019t tell you, okay? Yeah, you know, the first thing I asked them when they invited me was, \\u201cDoes B know?\\u201d \\u2018Cause otherwise this would be really fucking awkward. And now it is fucking awkward.\\nNo, no, not at all.\\nI\\u2019m in a lot of love.\\nNo, you\\u2019re like family. It\\u2019d be effing awkward if you weren\\u2019t here.\\nI\\u2019m so glad you\\u2019re here.\\nI\\u2019m so happy for you two. Hey, congratulations.\\nYeah, thanks.\\nRight?\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s great to see you.\\nIt\\u2019s great to see you too.\\nWe\\u2019re all going on a hike, so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out. Let\\u2019s move out.\\n[Bea] Ben, meet Jonathan.\\nOh, hey, man.\\nI\\u2019m Ben.\\nHey, oh, Pete and Claudia\\u2019s friend, right?\\nAlso friends with Bea, among other things.\\nYeah, it\\u2019s nice to meet you.\\nOkay, plenty of enough time in the car to do whatever the fuck this is. Come on, let\\u2019s go!\\nYeah, okay. Yeah.\\n[Bea] We need to come up with a game plan.\\nYeah, you are so terrible at this.\\n[Bea] What?\\nWe\\u2019re doing this thing!\\nHoney, I\\u2019m sorry. I know we should have asked you, but we had to invite you.\\nOh, it\\u2019s totally fine. I\\u2019m glad he\\u2019s here. I love him and Holly loves him.\\nReally?\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nGreat, okay. So we\\u2019re spending a little time together away from the real world and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, Mom, guys, no. I totally forgot to tell you, but I\\u2019m with Ben. \\u2026 Do you want to come?\\nI think I\\u2019m going to hang back and yell at your parents. Have fun.\\n\\nAlright, so is it like we just got together or we\\u2019ve been sneaking around? Oh, I got it. What if we ran into each other at Chipotle, lady in the tramp, the burrito?\\n[Bea] No.\\nThis can\\u2019t be that hard.\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s harder than you think. My parents don\\u2019t even believe it yet.\\nYou told them five seconds ago.\\n[Bea] They know I would never go out with a guy like you.\\nYou\\u2019ve been with one guy your entire life.\\n[Bea] Jonathan\\u2019s a better man than you\\u2019ll ever be.\\nAnd yet you left him. Which is why exactly? Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.\\n[Bea] Okay, you don\\u2019t know my boxes and you never will. Just figure this out, please.\\nOkay. We just suck face in front of everybody. Half of them think they set us up anyway.\\n[Bea] No, that\\u2019s too much. We need to do something that\\u2019s more hidden so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.\\nYou\\u2019re calling me a fuckboy like it\\u2019s an insult? I own that shit.\\n[Bea] Let\\u2019s just be affectionate. I know it\\u2019s a foreign concept for you.\\nI can be affectionate. I\\u2019ll affectionate the shit out of you.\\nI can\\u2019t believe your parents invited Jonathan. Now I have to find a table to sit him at.\\nWhat about Bea?\\nNo, no, she\\u2019s fine. She\\u2019s sitting with us at our table.\\nNo, I\\u2019m talking about how she\\u2019s already at a low point because she\\u2019s going through a breakup and I don\\u2019t even know what\\u2019s happening with school. She never even talks about it anymore.\\nI guess I could put up with the cousins.\\nWhy?\\nYou alright?\\nOh, shit.\\nWow.\\nCheck it out, guys!\\nNice!\\nYeah!\\nBeautiful!\\nSee, I told you it was going to be good.\\nMan, that\\u2019s nice.\\n[Bea] Oh, wow.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] So beautiful.\\nThere it is.\\nFeel the serenity.\\nPretty spectacular, hey?\\nIt\\u2019s amazing.\\n[Bea] Alright, your turn.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] This is just so romantic.\\nOkay, nuzzle my neck.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nGet in there. Damn, you are short.\\n[Bea] You are not tall enough to say that.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Oh, are you ticklish?\\nNo, I\\u2019m acting.\\n[Bea] Like a toddler?\\nNo, go away. Okay, I can use that.\\n[Bea] Beg me. Beg me to stuff you in the butt.\\nStop! Just let me do it. Permission to put my left hand on your right buttock.\\n[Bea] Granted. Too hard.\\nSorry. You gotta sell it.\\n[Bea] Okay, not in circles. It\\u2019s not a magic lamp.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Okay, now you\\u2019re just playing bop it.\\nI\\u2019ve never rubbed a bopper show.\\n[Bea] Clearly, you\\u2019ve tried. Are you not wearing underwear?\\nIt\\u2019s a swimsuit. I\\u2019m on holiday.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nOkay, just mind the gap.\\n[Bea] How\\u2019s that?\\nThat\\u2019s good. Just like, but you don\\u2019t have to hover. Just kind of, oh, man the woods.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m sorry.\\nOkay, just take it out.\\n[Bea] You try.\\nYou want me to stick my finger in my own ass? How\\u2019s that gonna convince? Oh, on you. I can\\u2019t. Jesus Christ, it\\u2019s like a vacuum pack down here. How\\u2019d you get in this thing? Oh, man, it\\u2019s tight. Oh, see, it\\u2019s like holding a baby bird.\\n[Bea] God damn it.\\nWere they not watching this whole time?\\n[Bea] You like a mole or something on your butt?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really? \\u2018Cause I feel something.\\nI don\\u2019t have a mole. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Are there any more on me?\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t know.\\nJack, spiders hunt bears. They hunt bears.\\nNo pictures. Put the cameras down. We\\u2019re not gonna take a spirit.\\nAre there any more?\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t know.\\nWhere are they? I feel it. I feel it.\\n[Bea] I think I see something.\\nWhat do you see? What do you see?\\n[Bea] Oh, no, that\\u2019s just a part of you. You\\u2019re fine.\\nAll right, look, if I have one of those little fuckers in me, they might be in you.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m good.\\nThat\\u2019s probably a better way to check than what I did.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nAll right, little one, we join your journey. We do not inherit the earth. We just borrow it from our creatures.\\nHey, guys. What did we miss?\\nWow.\\n\\nWhy can\\u2019t I get this?\\nBecause you\\u2019re meant to learn to dive when you\\u2019re six.\\nYou got this, hon.\\nYou ever try focusing on your toes? My mom taught me this trick. If you pretend like there\\u2019s a string from your nose to your toes, you just kind of maintain that position. You mind doing it again? This time I\\u2019m going to shout out a tribute question. I think it\\u2019s just going to help clear your mind.\\nJust make sure it\\u2019s a question about airplanes or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\\nOkay, um, uh, what company created the Concorde?\\nA collaboration between British Airways and the French government. How\\u2019d I do?\\nYou\\u2019re good there.\\nMaybe your mom can teach him how to dive.\\nShe passed away.\\nOh, I\\u2019m so sorry.\\nYeah, sorry.\\nAll right, I\\u2019m going to go again, but this time give me one with a little shorter answer.\\nI have a better idea. You just let me do everything, I\\u2019ll guide you in. Don\\u2019t think.\\nBe careful of his shoulder.\\nYeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.\\nWouldn\\u2019t let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.\\nI had to tell her I love her. When you know she\\u2019s the one, nothing else matters.\\nI\\u2019m waving, thank you, thank you.\\nThere you go.\\nDid I do it?\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Good job, babe.\\nYour dad\\u2019s a natural.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m so glad you guys got to spend some time with Ben.\\nAre you two really\\u2026\\n\\u2026getting to know each other in a very respectful manner? One befitting such a kind and intelligent woman as your daughter.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are in the early stages.\\nNot too early.\\n[Bea] But also not so advanced.\\nJust that magical moment when two people come together in this crazy journey we call life.\\n[Bea] That\\u2019s why I was so worried when Jonathan showed up. I don\\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.\\nI even suggested we hide our light under a bushel for his sake.\\n[Bea] But our love is just so strong. And I know what you guys are thinking. He\\u2019s much older.\\nThey weren\\u2019t, right? Probably thinking I\\u2019m 27, early 28s.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are very happy.\\nHappiest.\\n[Bea] Yep.\\nYou know, you looked like that back in the day.\\nNo, I didn\\u2019t. That guy\\u2019s made out of cobblestone.\\nThey\\u2019re holding hands.\\nI think it\\u2019s working.\\nI can\\u2019t believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.\\n[Bea] Was that bullshit about your mom?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] The story about the giant wrench. I thought it might have been a lie until all your one night nothings.\\nYou ever heard that too?\\n[Bea] Like, I didn\\u2019t mean\\u2026 I\\u2019m sorry. And it wasn\\u2019t a lie.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so nice to my dad. You should probably rinse off. You have his SPF a billion on you now.\\nCheers, mate. I\\u2019ll just grab a quickie.\\nOkay.\\nSo, Australia. What do you reckon, eh? How you finding it?\\nI don\\u2019t know. It\\u2019s great.\\nMaz goes on about you all the time. Ripper Cunt, she calls you.\\nMaz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is\\u2026\\nGood friend. Oh, yeah. You know you had a proper surf when sand gets all up your clacker. And your gobbler, too.\\nGobbler is\\u2026\\nYou know, your hog bonnet. You know, your beef cap. Come on, mate. You know, the anteater. Anyway, good to have ya. Gotcha.\\nG\\u2019day, love.\\nHey, mate. Fancy a game?\\n[Bea] You\\u2019re going down. How have you been doing?\\nPretty good. You?\\n[Bea] Okay, I guess.\\nHow\\u2019s school going? Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?\\n[Bea] You know me. I\\u2019ve never been one for practicing.\\nStill having second thoughts?\\n[Bea] Straight to third.\\nI know it\\u2019s weird, me being here, but believe me, I had nothing to do with it. Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.\\n[Bea] That\\u2019s sweet. You\\u2019re part of the family.\\nI\\u2019d be lying if I said I haven\\u2019t been thinking about you.\\n[Bea] Yeah, me too.\\nHow long have you and that guy, Ben, been?\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s kind of new. Not like new, new, but newish.\\nWell, I think he seems great.\\n[Bea] No, you don\\u2019t.\\nI really don\\u2019t.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so cool about all of this. Not just this, but this too.\\nIt\\u2019s really good to see you, Bea.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m glad you\\u2019re here. Now let\\u2019s have fun.\\nLet\\u2019s do it.\\nMate.\\nThat\\u2019s me.\\nYou want a coffee? It\\u2019s the best in the world.\\nYou guys are really proud of your coffee here.\\nIt\\u2019s the best in the fucking world.\\nOkay.\\nEnjoy.\\nFuck, that is good.\\nI was thinking of going for a bit of a run later. Do you want to join?\\nI\\u2019m actually going on a bike ride with Bea, so I don\\u2019t think I can.\\nShe\\u2019s a little sweet on you, hey?\\nOh, you caught that.\\nHow long have you and Beau been together?\\nNah, we\\u2019re just banging about. He\\u2019s nice, but I think I\\u2019m looking for someone less casual. More romantic.\\nWow.\\nWhy did me and you ever break up anyway?\\nI don\\u2019t really remember, but I think you said something like I was an immature, drongo, smothered in ex body spray.\\nSmells like you\\u2019re not that guy anymore. Bea\\u2019s a lucky girl.\\nOh.\\nHey, open the door. Bea.\\n[Bea] What\\u2019s wrong?\\nMargaret thinks we\\u2019re together.\\n[Bea] That\\u2019s great.\\nNo, Margaret needs to think we\\u2019re the right type of together. Not together together, but like situationally together. \\u2018Cause if she thinks we\\u2019re together together, she\\u2019s not gonna break girl code. So we need to finesse our togetherness so that we\\u2019re together, but there\\u2019s an opening for our togetherness and she can just slide right in so that we can be together.\\n[Bea] Are you on Coke?\\nNo, it\\u2019s like coffee here. It\\u2019s like meth. I\\u2019m guessing. No, I\\u2019m not. I worked at Goldman. Partner\\u2019s wedding. Do what you do.\\n[Bea] Jesus, dude, who are you?\\nI\\u2019m a man trying to figure this out. Look at your room, it\\u2019s so much bigger. You got a painting? Wow, that\\u2019s so red. We have to kick it up a notch. Make it feel like we\\u2019re in the Gaga stage.\\n[Bea] What do you wanna do, take me in the hallway?\\nThat is not Gaga. Actually, that could be construed as Gaga. Tonight\\u2019s the rehearsal dinner, so we have to do something that makes it look like you\\u2019re into me, but you\\u2019re not into me. And I\\u2019m into you, but you can tell by my face that it\\u2019s never gonna mount.\\n[Bea] Get it together, man.\\nYou hit me so much.\\n\\nOkay, Kalana, now pretend this is a real fox that messed up our garden. Fuck it up. Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up. Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up. Fuck it up. Ooh. You see that?\\nHe did it, yeah. Oh, hey, they\\u2019re here. All right, everybody, wheels up.\\nHustle up.\\nBad dog.\\nYou look cute.\\nBaby, you look so good.\\nShe\\u2019s has been.\\nYou look so good.\\nYeah, I look bad.\\nMan, this is the best time to say that.\\nDaddy\\u2019s a dad.\\nCome on, let\\u2019s go.\\nYeah.\\nAll right, let\\u2019s do it.\\nThank you.\\nYou see the size of that boat?\\nHey, guys.\\nWoo!\\n[Bea] Nice touch.\\nNice dress.\\nYou have a good heart.\\nI love this dress.\\nYou look fine.\\nOh, thank you.\\nWhat would you like to drink?\\nWhat\\u2019s a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?\\nThree scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.\\nOh, thank you.\\nAll right.\\nYou remembered.\\nThat you can\\u2019t handle hard liquor? Yeah, the smell\\u2019s still not out of my car.\\nYou know I feel really bad about that. That was a fun night. That was a fun summer.\\nMarks! Marks, captain says that we can steer the ship.\\nOh, okay, I\\u2019m coming. Hang on, I\\u2019ve got heels on.\\nLook how lucky we are. On a boat sailing back and forth with no real transportation or reason.\\nOkay.\\nAnd look at you, Polly Pocket. You the belle of the boat.\\nHe didn\\u2019t remember me.\\nOh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?\\nNo, honey, that\\u2019s, yes, I think it might be. Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.\\nThere it is.\\nWell, at least that was subtle.\\n[Bea] Was it?\\nThis oddly reminds me of prom.\\n[Bea] The first or second time?\\nJonathan is just the most perfect guy.\\nHe\\u2019s like a son to us.\\nWell, that might be a problem, mate. They might not wanna shag a brother.\\nSo how\\u2019s it going? Can parents back off a little?\\n[Bea] How about you?\\nGame on.\\n[Bea] Can you even dance?\\nYou just let me lead.\\n[Bea] Oh, God.\\nLet\\u2019s go.\\nIs Margaret watching?\\nIt\\u2019s a little hard to tell what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.\\nEverybody to the top deck, we about to do a champagne toast.\\n[Bea] Come with me.\\nSo what are we doing?\\n[Bea] Closing the deal. Titanic me.\\nWhat?\\nOh, help yourself to some champagne.\\nOh, thank you.\\nGrab some drinks.\\nOh, great.\\nNice.\\n[Bea] Titanic me.\\nNo, that is so lame.\\n[Bea] Exactly. The only people who would do something this lame are the ones who know how lame it is, but are in the first stages of liking each other, so they\\u2019re totally comfortable in their mutual lameness. Toast me.\\nOh my God.\\n[Bea] Come on.\\nThis is so cringe. So is saying cringe, old man.\\n[Bea] Lift my arms.\\nI\\u2019ve seen the movie.\\n[Bea] Have you?\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nThis is never gonna work.\\nAww! That is the cutest thing I\\u2019ve ever seen!\\nAre they doing Titanic?\\nAww!\\n[Bea] Are they watching?\\nYep.\\n[Bea] Are they buying it?\\nCan\\u2019t imagine they would.\\nIt\\u2019s real. We did it.\\nWe\\u2019re good. We\\u2019re really bloody good.\\nJonathan, have you seen Tasmania?\\nInya, I\\u2019m fine. It\\u2019s fine.\\nCan I do the line? That\\u2019s king of the world. You\\u2019re king of the world.\\n[Bea] Jack, I\\u2019m flying!\\nOkay, we can stop there.\\nWe can stop there.\\nThey\\u2019re gone. Show\\u2019s over.\\nOh my god!\\n[Bea] No! Wait for me! Help! Wait! Wait!\\nBae! Bea! Are you okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Why\\u2019d you jump in?\\nTo save you!\\n[Bea] But you\\u2019re a terrible swimmer!\\nI\\u2019m a great swimmer! Just short distances.\\n[Bea] We\\u2019re gonna die.\\nWe\\u2019re not gonna die.\\n[Bea] We\\u2019re gonna get hypothermia.\\nThe water\\u2019s 90 degrees.\\n[Bea] We\\u2019re gonna get eaten by sharks. Fuck! We\\u2019re gonna get eaten by sharks!\\nWe are gonna be fine. And we spent ten hours shredding water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.\\n[Bea] Goldman?\\nYeah, it was a partner\\u2019s kids bar mitzvah. A little bit of crack.\\nOh my god!\\nRoger!\\nOh my god!\\nIt looks like they\\u2019re going full Titanic. I love the commitment!\\nStop the boat!\\nNo, no, no.\\nHelp!\\nThey\\u2019re coming!\\nStay calm!\\nThis is not a very good swim.\\nBei!\\nThere.\\n[Bea] Are you sure?\\nYeah. Come on.\\nWhy aren\\u2019t we turning the boat around?\\nWe are in too shallow of water. We\\u2019ll run aground.\\nBut harbour rescue has been notified.\\nCome on.\\nAre you good?\\n[Bea] Mm-hmm.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] All right. Okay.\\nLet\\u2019s go.\\n[Bea] All right, get in the row.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] That was, um, probably the most\\u2013 I mean, if you didn\\u2019t close it with Margaret, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 There\\u2019s nothing more romantic than jumping in to save me.\\nYeah, well, Jonathan didn\\u2019t do it, that\\u2019s for sure. Your parents half the clock, that\\u2019s shit.\\n[Bea] You didn\\u2019t even give him a chance.\\nWhy do you keep defending this guy? Why do you break up with him in the first place?\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s complicated.\\nIt\\u2019s never complicated. What, he cheated on you? Drug problem? Did you catch him measuring his dick with a ruler app?\\n[Bea] We never fought.\\nIsn\\u2019t that a good thing?\\n[Bea] It was just comfortable. And he\\u2019s a great guy, which means there\\u2019s no one out there for me because I had the best one. I couldn\\u2019t even tell him I quit law school. And I have no idea what I\\u2019m gonna do with my life. We\\u2019re gonna get eaten by sharks, I had to tell somebody.\\nNo one else knows?\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.\\nYou finally did it.\\n[Bea] What?\\nYou know, one night you said you didn\\u2019t want to be a lawyer anyways.\\n[Bea] You remember that?\\nIt was a memorable night, until you snuck out, of course. Why did you?\\n[Bea] Because you scared the shit out of me. It was the first time in my life that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.\\nI know a little bit about that. I was really hurt when you left. So I said all that terrible stuff about you to Pete. That\\u2019s not how I felt.\\n[Bea] Look at us. Just a couple of fucked up people floating in the middle of the harbor. Promise me if we make it out alive we\\u2019ll go see that from dry land.\\nIt\\u2019s a pretty killer view from here.\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s dumb but I want to see the people. Landmarks like those are full of people in love. Marriage proposals, honeymooners, romantics jumping off of moving trains just to see the building with the person they love.\\nLike your dad in the Eiffel Tower?\\n[Bea] He told you that?\\nNothing else matters when it comes to love.\\n[Bea] You could use a bit of that right now.\\nIt\\u2019s not dumb. You, me and the opera house. It\\u2019s a date. I promise.\\n[Bea] What\\u2019s wrong?\\nI\\u2019m a little afraid of flying.\\n[Bea] Don\\u2019t you fly all the time for your job?\\nI have a very specific routine. I mask, headphones, build my bubble.\\nThat\\u2019s my Serenity song. How do you know my Serenity song?\\n[Bea] Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\n[Bea] You all good?\\nShut the fuck up now!\\nThanks again.\\nStay out of the water, yeah?\\nWant some coffee?\\n[Bea] Not the stuff from here. I\\u2019ll be up all night.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Thanks for kind of saving me though.\\nIt was fun.\\n[Bea] Stupid, but fun.\\nWell, that\\u2019s the best kind.\\n\\nNo, no, no, it\\u2019s hot!\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m warm.\\nWhen are you ever gonna learn? Like, you want me to blow on it? \\u2026 Is it still hot?\\nWe\\u2019re getting pretty good at faking it.\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t even know what\\u2019s real anymore. Everything I do just feels like a mistake.\\nBen, Steve, are you guys all right?\\nBen, wait, you hear?\\nI can\\u2019t hear you.\\nSteve!\\nBeatrice! Beatrice!\\n\\nHoney, what are these? Is that a handprint?\\nNo.\\nCome on, baby gorgeous. We got chores. Come on, let\\u2019s go. Ben, are you ready? We got groom stuff to do.\\nDude, I\\u2019m coming, I\\u2019m coming.\\nMan, I hope you scrub from top to bottom, \\u2019cause who knows what was in that heart rate.\\nI also showered last night.\\nTwo showers in eight hours? Go off, King, get clean!\\n[Bea] Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?\\nYes, I\\u2019m so excited to marry Claudia. But, you know, I\\u2019m also hosting a party where it feels like we\\u2019re all playing parts in a play, and I\\u2019m not really into the pageantry, and I kinda just wanna do a little\\u2013\\n[Bea] All that matters is that you and Claudia run for the rest of your lives together.\\nI love you.\\n[Bea] I love you too.\\nBae? Hey, you\\u2019re still good to get the cake, right?\\n[Bea] Yes, ma\\u2019am.\\nAwesome. I put Margaret on it with you, just to be safe.\\n[Bea] Margaret.\\n\\nAll right, talk to me, baby. Who\\u2019s it gonna be, Margaret or Bae?\\nCome on, man, don\\u2019t give me that.\\nWe\\u2019re just two girls talking. I get it, though. It\\u2019s tough. Magpie\\u2019s your dream girl. She\\u2019s confident, beautiful, and she knows how to put out a fire with her attire. Now Bae\\u2019s waxing her other hand. Whoo! She\\u2019s smart, funny, quick, and she got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of.\\nPeter.\\nWhat? I\\u2019m not objectifying Margaret, man. That\\u2019d be inappropriate. That\\u2019s my cousin.\\nIt\\u2019s inappropriate with Bae too.\\nThis is deeper than I thought. Hey, Sydney! My boy is in love!\\nStop, dude, just stop.\\nWhat?\\nI know what you\\u2019re doing. I know what you\\u2019ve all been doing. You set us up, and we went along with it. But it\\u2019s fake.\\nIt was my stepdad, right? He can\\u2019t act for shit.\\nYou suck too, bro.\\nThat\\u2019s foul, dog. It\\u2019s definitely gotta be Bae, man.\\nI don\\u2019t know, man. I don\\u2019t fucking know. She doesn\\u2019t know what she wants. She\\u2019s single for basically the first time in her life. She just quit law school. Her fucking fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s here.\\nMan, stop with all the white boy\\u2013\\nWhat the\\u2013\\nHey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Seriously. Anytime something gets real, you run away, call yourself a fuckboy, make an excuse, and you just move on to the next. It\\u2019s Bae. You jumped off a boat for her.\\nOh, that\\u2019s perfect.\\n[Bea] They\\u2019re gonna love it. Thank you so much.\\nLet me get this boxed up for you.\\nThank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nI don\\u2019t get all the pageantry of weddings. If you like someone, give \\u2019em a snog. Keep it to yourselves.\\n[Bea] I wore a wedding dress for Halloween for five years in a row.\\nStop it.\\n[Bea] No, I know. It\\u2019s so pathetic. But I am with you now. This is not for me.\\nSo you and Ben aren\\u2019t serious?\\n[Bea] What?

January 26, 2024, marked the debut of Badland Hunters on the American platform. This film is actor Heo Myeong-haeng\\u2019s directorial debut, known for his roles in Old Boy and Arahan, and recently for directing The Roundup: Punishment, the fourth explosive installment of the series, set to premiere at the 74th Berlinale\\u2019s special events.\\nWritten by Kim Bo-tong and Kwak Jae-min, the story takes us to a post-apocalyptic Seoul, devastated by a catastrophic earthquake, turning the city into a wild, desolate wasteland inhabited by desperate souls and ruthless armed gangs. In this chaotic world where water is more precious than gold, a brave hunter named Nam-san (played by international star Don Lee, known for Train to Busan and as Gilgamesh in Eternals) steps up when a dear teenager is kidnapped by a deranged scientist conducting human experiments to create an immortal race, within a \\u201ccondo,\\u201d the only building left standing after the disaster. The plot of Badland Hunters is pretty bare-bones, offering just what\\u2019s needed for a dystopian fantasy-action film aimed at no-frills entertainment, reminiscent of the platform\\u2019s similar venture, Black Knight, a somewhat lackluster series adaptation by Cho Ui-seok from the webtoon Delivery Knight by Lee Yun-gyun.\\n* * *\\n[whirring, beeping]\\n[somber music playing]\\n[squelching]\\n[man gasping]\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[moans]\\n[object clatters]\\nSo-yeon.\\n[gasps]\\n[device beeping]\\n[tense music playing]\\nRight.\\nSo-yeon.\\nSo-yeon.\\nI\\u2019m gonna try again.\\nI swear you\\u2019re gonna live, okay?\\n[banging at door]\\n[banging continues]\\n[banging continues]\\n[woman] Gi-su!\\n[man gasps]\\n\\n\\n\\nYang Gi-su!\\nStop right now.\\nJust let So-yeon go.\\nI have to revive her.\\nShe\\u2019ll be dead if we don\\u2019t act now.\\nDon\\u2019t make me shoot.\\nGi-su, wait.\\nYou\\u2019ve taken over a hundred lives with these horrific experiments.\\nThis isn\\u2019t what So-yeon would have wanted.\\nYour daughter\\u2019s not going to come back.

Nice to meet you.\\nWe actually have started a safe haven in Seoul.\\nI\\u2019m the leader of our organization\\u2019s volunteer group, and\\u2026\\n[whispers] I think that\\u2019s the same place I mentioned before.\\nBut, uh, why us though?\\nUh, you see,\\nwe\\u2019re prioritizing the safety of families with children below 20.\\nWe believe that protecting our youth is the only way to save humanity.\\nSu-na, if you come with us, your grandmother will live comfortably for the rest of her life.\\nWe have clean water and plenty of food in storage.\\nYou have clean water?\\nOh my God, that\\u2019s incredible.\\nIf that place is so amazing, then it\\u2019s gonna be a target for the gangs.\\nYou ever stop to consider that?\\n[laughs]\\nThere\\u2019s a security force of armed ex-military soldiers, which means that the gangs couldn\\u2019t possibly make a move on us.\\nWell, in that case, can the two of them come with us?\\nThey\\u2019re like family to me.\\n[Teacher] I\\u2019m sorry.\\nWe can only take direct family members right now.\\nMa\\u2019am, I\\u2019m sorry, but I need your answer soon.\\nFor Su-na\\u2019s sake,\\nI hope that you\\u2019re going to make the right choice here.\\nAnd unfortunately, we\\u2019re going to have to find someone else if you say no.\\nThe thing is, ma\\u2019am, my grandmother is not well,\\nand she won\\u2019t be able to walk that whole way.\\nWe have medical staff standing by at the halfway point to ensure everyone on our watch arrives safely. Don\\u2019t worry.\\nShe\\u2019s right. Su-na, we should go.\\nYou should go. It has to be better than this.\\nRight.

And that complexion would look great with the right makeup.\\nHey, she stuffed that snake in her nose.\\nWho does that?\\nThat\\u2019s enough.\\nOkay? Enough.\\n[Nam San sighs wearily]\\nWhere you going?\\nUgh, you\\u2019re running your mouth too much, so I\\u2019m getting some air.\\nGoing on a night hunt?\\nThat\\u2019s right.\\nLet me come with you.\\nGrandma, are you alright?\\nUh-huh.\\nYes, dear, don\\u2019t you worry about me.\\nWatch your step here.\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[Teacher exhales]\\nOh, don\\u2019t worry.

I heard the place is amazing.\\nFirst thing I\\u2019m gonna do when we get there is take a shower.\\nIt still feels like the bugs are clinging to my skin right now.\\n[wolf howls]\\n[man] I wonder if Su-na\\u2019s made it there by now.\\nGod, I wish I could go there with her.\\n[sighs] Man, I really don\\u2019t wanna have to let her go.\\nYou know we can go see her when we visit, right?\\nNo.\\nThe jewelry woman.\\nI always wanted that kind of mother.\\nAlright, you little\\u2026 Come here!\\nHey, okay, I get it!\\n[Su-na] Careful.\\n[grandmother groaning]\\nOh God!

Today, we\\u2019ll learn why we need to change our metabolism.\\nOpen your books, everyone.\\nLet\\u2019s first talk about the anatomy of humans as things stand.\\nBecause we currently need to drink water and consume food in order to survive, we\\u2019ve wasted precious resources on people that do not serve the greater cause.\\nTo be frank, we are weak, and in our current world, which is plagued by a shortage of water, mankind needs to take a new, stronger physical form.\\nWe must develop a new metabolic system in order to breed humans that can survive for extended periods of dehydration and malnutrition, thereby reversing the population decline and paving the way for civilization to be reborn.\\nChildren, in this harsh and unforgiving world, always remind yourselves of Dr. Yang Gi-su\\u2019s miracle and of your own responsibilities.\\nOur metabolism will improve through Dr. Yang\\u2019s research, and eventually, mankind will finally be given a body which can adapt to this brave new world.\\nPay attention, Su-na.\\nIt\\u2019s just odd.\\nNobody even has enough to drink on the outside, yet the people here are able to drink however much they want and even shower.\\nEveryone keeps going on and on about Dr. Yang Gi-su.\\nShouldn\\u2019t he be giving water to everybody out there who needs it?\\n[unsettling music playing]\\nOh, Su-na.\\nThe outside world is full of barbarians.\\nThe exact same type that killed Yang Gi-su\\u2019s beloved daughter.\\nIn order to join the new humanity,\\nyou need to be the right kind of person.\\nWhat kind\\u2026 what kind of person is that?\\n[Ju-ye] People that offer aid in furthering the doctor\\u2019s research.\\nI wanna be a part of the research support.\\nWell, you sound like you have the right attitude, Ju-ye, no?\\nSu-na sure could learn a lot from you.\\n[Ju-ye] Yes, ma\\u2019am.\\n[Teacher] Now, then, for our next lesson, we\\u2019ll be learning about organisms that are best at surviving in the wild.\\nWe\\u2019ll be getting a visit from Dr. Yang Gi-su later, so let\\u2019s all welcome him properly to show our gratitude.\\n[all] Yes.\\n[exhales]\\n[Teacher] These rations are the fruits of your parents\\u2019 hard work, as I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all aware.\\nLet us all dig in with a thankful heart.\\nAnd there\\u2019s the water, which is more valuable than anything else in this world.\\nMake sure to drink it all down to the very last drop.\\nDr. Yang Gi-su had it specially purified for all of you here.\\nJu-ye.\\n[Gi-su] Hello, everyone.\\n[Teacher] Alright, a round of applause, everyone.\\nAttention.\\nBow.\\n\\u201cStudents are our hope.\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all aware of our apartment\\u2019s motto, right?\\nThat\\u2019s the reason we\\u2019ve been supplying our students with a special diet.\\n[inhales] The world is beset by a shortage of food and water, as you know.\\nI\\u2019m working day and night to create a new world where humans are going to be able to survive and live a good life with only a minuscule amount of food and drinking water.\\nBut until that day comes, you all need to finish everything you\\u2019re given, making sure not to waste any.\\nYes.\\nAlright.\\nDoctor, we have someone very promising.\\nOh, there.\\nMm-hmm. She\\u2019s wonderful.\\nHer name?\\n[Teacher] Lee Ju-ye.\\n[Gi-su] Lee Ju-ye, right?\\nYes.\\nHi. You\\u2019re 18?\\nYeah!\\nI heard you really wanted to help me with my research.\\n[Ju-ye] Mm.\\nWhy don\\u2019t we get the ball rolling with a consultation?\\n[Teacher] Yes, of course.\\nUh-huh.\\nWell, uh, why don\\u2019t we have you eat first?\\nUh, I\\u2019ll send someone over to meet you in three hours, huh? And then we can get started.\\nOh wow! Thank you, Doctor. [giggles]\\n[Gi-su] Right.\\nLet\\u2019s go.\\nDr. Yang.\\nWhere\\u2019s my grandmother? Did she get here safe?\\nOf course she did. Don\\u2019t you worry.\\nIf my grandmother\\u2019s here, I wanna see her.\\n[Gi-su exhales in annoyance]\\nExcuse me.\\nDid you explain everything to her?\\n[gasps]\\nI\\u2019m so sorry.\\n[unsettling music playing]\\nSu-na.\\nUh, your grandmother is much worse than we expected, so we\\u2019ll have to keep her in treatment for the next two to three days.\\nGrandma got that sick on the way here?\\n[chuckles nervously]\\nShe just needs to rest, okay?\\nYou\\u2019re going to be able to see her in a day or so.\\nDr. Yang Gi-su himself is personally seeing to her treatment\\u2026\\nYes, of course. Now,\\nI have been overseeing her care, so don\\u2019t worry, okay?\\nShe\\u2019s going to be much better soon, and\\u2026\\nOh, Su-na.\\nSu-na, you\\u2019re terribly malnourished right now. Huh?\\nSo drink some water.\\nYou\\u2019ll regain your health. Here.\\nHmm?\\nAlright, then. Enjoy your dinners, and don\\u2019t forget,\\nyou are our future!\\n[unsettling music building]\\n[music fades]\\n[groaning weakly]\\n[exhales forcefully]\\nAlright, clean things up here.\\n[woman] Yes, sir.\\nIt\\u2019s been over 20 hours, and Sergeant Choi and Sergeant Oh haven\\u2019t returned.\\nThings could get bad for them if they don\\u2019t make it in time.\\n[Gi-su] They should be okay.\\nMaybe we should hand out personal doses in case of situations like this.\\n[sighs]\\nIt\\u2019s still too dangerous for people to carry.\\nBesides, there\\u2019s no telling what kind of side effects we\\u2019ll see going forward.\\nHow long are we going to have to keep injecting?\\nWe\\u2019re starting to run out of children to bring to the apartment.\\nWe\\u2019re gonna get there.\\nJust be patient.\\n[Kwon exhales]\\nGet back to work.\\nThey only care about themselves.\\nDignity for humans?\\nLong gone.\\n[breathes deeply]\\nThis research needs to come to fruition, right?\\nIf we want a meaningful life\\u2026 it\\u2019ll only be when\\u2026 when they realize the sacrifices of these evolutionary rejects was necessary for survival.\\nThat day will come, don\\u2019t you think?\\n[grunts]\\n[sighs]\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[lock clicks]\\n[music fades]\\nTime for a shift change.\\n[indistinct chatter]\\nExcuse me. Excuse me.\\n[chuckles]\\nUh, we, uh, signed up to see our child earlier on.\\nWhen will we be able to go see her?\\nA meeting? What do you mean, meeting?\\nThe teacher said that after we finish our work for the day,\\nwe could sign up to visit our daughter.\\nUh, there\\u2019s, um\\u2026\\nWe don\\u2019t have that policy.\\nShe definitely told us that earlier on.\\nWe\\u2019re happy to go to the eighth floor if Ju-ye can\\u2019t come down.\\nThe eighth floor is especially off-limits to regular residents.\\nUh, well, where\\u2019s the teacher, then?\\n[sighs] You know what? Where\\u2019s our daughter?\\nWhat the hell do you mean we can\\u2019t go see our child?\\nThis is ridiculous!\\n[man] They\\u2019re stopping them seeing their child.\\n[woman] I hope our kids are okay.\\nDon\\u2019t mind us and change shifts, everyone.\\nWe\\u2019ll talk about this tomorrow.\\nWait, wait, wait. Where\\u2019s Ju-ye?\\nNo, look here.\\nHuh? Where the hell is our daughter, you bastards?!\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[breathing heavily]\\n[door opens]\\n[gasps]\\nListen, how many times do I have to tell you not to interrupt me when I\\u2019m experimenting?\\nI\\u2019m sorry, sir.

              "'\\n\\nBea, a law student with doubts about her path, connects instantly with the charming, yet arrogant, Ben on a whirlwind first date. Their passion cools overnight, however, leaving Bea heartbroken and fuming after overhearing Ben’s dismissive remarks to a friend. Years later, fate throws them together at a luxurious Australian wedding, forcing them to share space and endure awkward family gatherings – not helped by the presence of Bea’s persistent ex-fiancé and Ben’s jealous ex-girlfriend.\\nIn an attempt to ease the tension and ensure a smooth celebration, the wedding party hatches a mischievous plan: convince everyone Bea and Ben are a happy couple. Despite initial resistance, fuelled by personal motives, both agree to the charade. Bea seeks escape from her ex’s shadow, while Ben hopes to spark jealousy in his old flame.\\nAs they navigate the masquerade, participating in romantic couple activities and faking intimate moments, something unexpected happens. The line between pretense and reality blurs. Underneath the bickering and witty banter, they discover unexpected vulnerabilities and shared passions, leading to a genuine connection they can’t ignore.\\nTheir budding romance faces obstacles: Jonathan’s disapproval, Bea’s overbearing parents, and the inevitable exposure of their charade. But through humorous confrontations and self-reflection, they learn to trust each other and fight for their newfound love. In the end, defying expectations and overcoming external pressures, Ben and Bea choose to embrace their feelings, leaving the future open to exciting possibilities.\\nTheir journey is not just about finding love, but also about self-discovery. Bea sheds her insecurities and carves her own path, while Ben confronts his emotional walls and learns to be vulnerable. Their relationship, born from a playful ruse, blossoms into something authentic and true, reminding us that love can sometimes surprise us in the most unexpected places.\\n\\n* * *\\n[Bea] Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.\\n[Bea] Hi. Where’s your bathroom?\\nIt’s for customers only.\\n[Bea] Oh, okay. I’ll buy something.\\nYou gotta pay up there.\\n[Bea] Can I just go now? I really have to pee.\\nI’ve got a large cappuccino for Skylar.\\nThanks.\\n[Bea] I also kind of, well, no… I know that establishments that serve food or drink must be open to the public regardless of their purchasing class.\\nSorry, it’s our policy.\\n[Bea] Store policy can’t really supersede state law. Please, it’s an emergency.\\nCaramel latte for Miranda.\\nHoney, I’m about to order. Do you want your usual?\\n[Bea] Uh.\\nMy wife would like a double espresso although you’ve had trouble sleeping lately, right babe? Maybe we should back it off to a single. You kept the light on until like midnight last night.\\n[Bea] I did, didn’t I? Yeah, so maybe I’ll just have a peppermint tea with two sugars. Thanks, husband.\\nOh, and the bread. It’s grilled cheese night. And she is part of the purchasing class, so can we get the bathroom key? Thank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you. That was really nice.\\nHappy to. You knew a lot about bathroom law.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] It was a short chapter. Thank you.\\nOh. I’ll have your tea waiting for you. Can’t leave my wife.\\n[Bea] Oh. Okay. That’s great. I will see you on the other side.\\n\\n[Bea] Hallie, I just met this guy and I don’t know, it was something. Well, I know it’s been a while, but I’m pretty sure he bought me a tea and he might have just stolen my coat. But what do I do? Oh no, this is the time that I’m supposed to be meeting people and doing things. Hallie, I gotta call you back. God damn it.\\nAre you okay?\\n[Bea] Big time. I am big time okay. I just had to pee for like the last six hours and I just started this new internship. And I didn’t want to ask anyone where the bathroom was because I didn’t want them to think I was weak and not a problem solver.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. Every human does it. It’s very, very normal.\\nYeah.\\nPeppermint tea, two sugars.\\n[Bea] Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Hi.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nOh, hey. You…\\n[Bea] So are you going to ask me out now?\\nYeah. Yeah, I am. I’m Ben.\\n[Bea] I’m Bea.\\n[Bea] So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, you would not be able to protect us?\\nNo, no. You’d be dead.\\n[Bea] You would let me die?\\nI’m not going to let you die. I’m just going to survive. You’re right. You’re right. You’re right.\\n[Bea] I was a gymnast.\\nGymnast?\\n[Bea] Yes. For like five years. I got like sixth place on beam.\\n\\n\\n\\nSixth place?\\n[Bea] Yes. Got a ribbon.\\nI’m impressed.\\n[Bea] Everybody gets a ribbon.\\nAll right, wait to cool down. You just saw me take it off the burning stove.\\n[Bea] Oh, my God.\\nIf you’re going to be a lawyer, you got to understand negligence and breach and McDonald’s versus that lady’s habeas corpus.\\n[Bea] You used none of those terms properly.\\nHow do you know? You’re not a lawyer yet. It’s not too late to choose a more noble profession.\\n[Bea] Oh, like you?\\nYou’re right. Stick with it. I’m going to need a lawyer at some point.\\n[Bea] I don’t even know if I want to be a lawyer. I cannot believe I just said that out loud. I’m sorry. My life is a disaster right now.\\nMight be turning the corner. You just met me.\\n[Bea] Or I might end up in a suitcase. I mean, look at this place. It looks like every serial killer reenactment documentary. Why do you have a giant wrench?\\nOkay, it wouldn’t be a suitcase. It’d be a carry-on because you’re zero feet tall. And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how broken something is, there’s always a way to fix it. I’m sorry. I don’t know why I’m talking to you about my mom right now.\\n[Bea] Alright. Then tell me about that.\\nThat is a long story. Everybody survived.\\n[Bea] Great.\\n[Bea] Holly, I don’t know this guy. He’s fucking great.\\nYo, let’s go, Benny. Come on, cupcake. We’re gonna be late.\\n‘Sup, Pete.\\nNo way. You cooked? That girl you blew me off for stayed over?\\n[Bea] He asked me out and then I kind of asked him out and then we just walked around the city and we fell asleep talking. I don’t– I left before you could wake up. I don’t know why. Why did I? What the fuck am I doing? Okay, I love you. Bye. I’m so sorry I woke you up. I didn’t– This whole thing is so new to me. Bye.\\nYou got cheese and bread. You didn’t miss one ingredient. What you doing with that? Why you got the giant wrench? You told her about your mom, bro? You don’t tell nobody about your mom. Fuck, dog. You in love, man. About fucking time, man. My boy’s in love.\\nFuck that. I couldn’t get her out of here fast enough. This girl’s a disaster. She’s a nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIX MONTHS LATER\\nWant to get a mansion, a jacuzzi, a theater to watch my movies, a couple whips and lots of fancy things.\\nThe kids, they call the goonies.\\nI see the future crystal ball, mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall.\\nGot your girlfriend screaming all the cops.\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nClaudia.\\nHolly.\\nThere we go.\\nHey, what’s up, Glee?\\nBen, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.\\nAre we saying that now?\\nYeah, is that cool?\\nYeah, I mean, I don’t really like labels, but I like you a whole bunch. I like your friend a whole bunch. And if she wants to put a label on me, then she can sew it on wherever she wants. That was weird. That was weird. I’m not into S&M or anything like that, unless you are, which would be totally cool, you know? You do you.\\nWell, she really likes you, too. And that is very rare for her.\\nOh, look who’s talking.\\nHow’s the crowd in here tonight?\\nOver there, big boy.\\nOh, B.\\nDo ladies like dumplings? We just had the greatest dumplings.\\nPete, meet my sister. This is Pete, Claudia’s brother.\\n[Bea] Nice to meet you.\\nAnd Ben. Ben. This is Ben. We all grew up together.\\nHey.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nYou two know each other?\\nYeah, we met.\\n[Bea] Barely.\\nWow, that’s so random.\\n[Bea] I’m going to go grab a drink.\\nDoor’s that way if you’re looking to sneak out. I know that’s your thing.\\n[Bea] Well, I am a disaster.\\nLet’s go away from this.\\nYeah.\\nSo you a lawyer yet?\\n[Bea] Why? Do you need a defense attorney?\\nI’m just curious how you passed the class on ethics and not bailing on people.\\nI think that’s the jerk who B got with when she was on her break from Jonathan.\\nNo way. So B’s the coffee girl who ghosted him?\\nI thought she looked familiar, but I don’t see faces. I just see souls.\\nAt least he made her realize that Jonathan was the one.\\n[Bea] I’m engaged now.\\nGood for you. Where are you registered? I’ll buy you a broomstick.\\n[Bea] I’ll send you an invite. You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?\\nYou do remember. See, it did mean something to you.\\n[Bea] You’ll always be my rock bottom. The night I spent with a bitch.\\nDid she just call him a bitch?\\nYou think they’re going to physically fight?\\nOr fuck?\\nThat’s a fine line.\\n[Bea] Let’s just get through tonight for them, OK?\\nElle, she’s your sister. I’m sure the relationship won’t last long.\\n[Bea] She’s your friend. I question why they’re even together.\\nThen I’m going to get a drink and toast to never seeing you again.\\n[Bea] Cheers to that, bro.\\n\\nANYONE BUT YOU\\nSo before I pronounce this newlywed couple, if anyone has an issue with these two wonderful people joining together in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.\\nI have an objection.\\nLeo, don’t do this.\\nI have to, Annie. It’s just not right. There’s no way I can bless this union without their friends and family joining us to celebrate in Australia.\\nWe’re getting married in Sydney.\\n\\nWelcome on board. 2K to the front.\\nThank you, Sheryl.\\n51E, how long’s the flight?\\n16 hours. 51F, thanks. 73F, all the way to the back.\\nHey. Head of the wedding?\\n[Bea] Of my sister, yes, I am.\\nHow crazy is it that we’re on the same plane?\\n[Bea] Don’t think there’s thousands of flights flying to Sydney every day.\\nOh, there’s quite a few, actually. Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, some co-chairs. Serendipity, I guess.\\n[Bea] I don’t think that word means what you think it means.\\nSo where’s your fiance? Wait, is this him? Hey, I’m Ben. I was her hall pass on your break.\\nWhat?\\nOh my god, I forgot. Claude told me you dumped him. Did you sneak out on your wedding day?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Wow, you are a child.\\nIt’s a pretty long flight. Do you want anything from the front of the boat? Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?\\n[Bea] No, thank you. I’m all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.\\nNothing small about me.\\nWhat the fuck?\\nHave a good flight. See you there.\\n\\nWhy do so many of us feel stuck? How is it even a very successful? Often feel like there is something missing from their lives. Why do so many people spend years mystically thinking about choices they might have made? One answer to that problem, many of us are leading lives that are misaligned with our own deepest values and preferences.\\nThank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain. What psychology can teach us about living our most authentic lives?\\n[Bea] What the fuck?\\n\\nHey, Vinny! Vindale! OK, Vin, looking good.\\nThanks for picking me up, dude.\\nNot just you, my guy.\\nSpelling Bee!\\n[Bea] Hey!\\nOur sisters are getting married. How dope is that?\\n[Bea] I know, I’m so excited.\\nOh, great. All right, let’s hit it.\\nThank you. I hope all of you have a wonderful vacation. I wish you all the best for the Mid-Autumn Festival.\\nBye.\\nY’all ready for Australia?\\nCan’t wait for y’all to see where we stay. And the plan is so dope.\\nWe’re all staying at the same place?\\nYep, my stepdad’s house. Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.\\n[Bea] Sounds like a piece of information that could have been shared a little earlier.\\nWell, that’s because they think you guys hate each other, so they didn’t want to poke the beard.\\n\\nNot bad, right?\\nYou don’t even play tennis.\\nI know, but I feel sweet.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee, y’all.\\nMeet Kalonabee.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee.\\nAll over.\\nAll over.\\nSpin, spin, spin.\\nWoo-hoo!\\nHe was the only member of the family who was trans.\\nYeah, he was there.\\n[Bea] Whoa.\\nYou’re right. This place is insane.\\nI know. All right, let’s get some sand under your feet.\\nHave you guys made up?\\nAll good.\\n[Bea] We’re fine if he just stays away from me.\\nDon’t need an invitation for that.\\n[Bea] I think you do if you’re like this. You can’t leave me alone.\\nSame reason I slowed down at the car crash.\\nOkay, so you guys buried the hatchet, water under the bridge, two adults adulting like fucking adults.\\nOh, we did have a little bit of a last minute snafu though. You guys are gonna have to share a room. There’s only one bed, but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.\\nShe’s kidding.\\n[Bea] You’re funny. I can’t wait any longer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWait for me!\\nHallie’s such a goof.\\nShe’s good for you. She could use some spontaneity.\\nHey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.\\nI hope so. I have a million contingencies and scenarios for everything. And honestly, I just want this wedding to be beautiful because I love the shit out of her and I just wanna marry the bitch, you know what I’m saying?\\nYou’re such a romantic.\\nHey, don’t be mad at me, but Margaret’s here.\\nWhy would I be mad? She lives here, I was 100% expecting to see her.\\nYeah. Margaret, Margaret, look who’s here.\\nThere she is. 100%.\\nGo rip off the band-aid.\\nBabe!\\nHow’s it going, stranger?\\nI was hoping you’d come. I wanted to message you, but I didn’t know how you’d feel about hearing from me.\\nAre you kidding?\\n[Bea] I’m never leaving.\\nNever leave.\\n[Bea] How are mom and dad?\\nThey’re good. You know, mom now thinks she’s Australian and dad’s not at all pointing out every tiny little detail that’s different. They’re also a little worried how you’re gonna react to all this.\\n[Bea] What are you talking about?\\nWell, you know, everybody thought that you’d be the one getting married first. You always used to talk about your wedding growing up. You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress when I just used it to dress like a mummy, you know?\\n[Bea] Hallie, stop. That’s not me anymore. I’m free now. I’m deprogrammed. That does not mean I don’t support you and your misguided view that soulmates exist.\\nThat’s sweet. Is that gonna be your toast?\\n[Bea] You and Claudia are the exception. I’m really happy for you, for real. What’s going on over there?\\nThat’s Claudia’s cousin. She visited the States a few years back. They dated. No biggie. Broke up with him. Crushed his heart.\\nNo way, that man does not have a heart.\\nFeels like forever ago. We were babies.\\nI’m really happy you’re here. We can reconnect as maybe not babies.\\nI would love that. Beau! Come eat my mate. Ben, this is my partner, Beau.\\nHi, mate.\\nLike, tennis partner?\\nSometimes after. How do you two dags know each other?\\nWe had a bit of a go back when, didn’t we?\\nDid you now? Good on ya. Hey, we’re gonna go trotting this weekend. Hit up the turps out here, eh? It’s gonna be a cracker. Woo!\\nYou know it.\\nGreat guy.\\nYeah.\\n\\nMommy!\\nHey, Beatrice.\\n[Bea] Dad!\\nYou made it.\\nOh, baby.\\nHi, baby.\\nHi, honey.\\nOh, my God.\\nWow.\\nHow’s our future lawyer?\\n[Bea] Great.\\nGreat.\\n[Bea] How’s the trip been?\\nOh, magical. The Australians are all wonderful. And excuse me, but good looking.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nWhy are they so weird about their plugs? I mean, this place is basically America. They speak English, they eat regular food, they have a complicated relationship with their past.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI’m doing okay.\\n[Bea] I’m doing great. My big sister’s getting married.\\nCould have been you. Could still be you someday.\\nHave you heard from Jonathan? Did he call or anything?\\nWell, that didn’t take long.\\nWe’re just torn up that he’s not part of our family anymore.\\nI mean, he works at our house every night from like 11 years old. He was basically family. Was about to be actual family.\\n[Bea] If I never ask you for anything ever again, can you please just lay off of me this weekend?\\nI just want both of our daughters to be happy.\\n[Bea] I’m very happy, but not when you guys do this.\\nNed, you in the right direction? He’s such a great guy. Just think on it, yeah?\\n\\nBee, dinner at 7.30, okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Yeah.\\nBen, all set for dinner, yeah?\\nYeah, I’ll be there.\\n\\nI was plagiarizing.\\nHey!\\nHi Ben!\\nHey Ben!\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nEverybody?\\nDad’s speech.\\nOh yes, right, okay. We’re gonna make this short, because you’ve all traveled a bloody long distance, and Carol and I are so appreciative. Biggest thing we’ve missed since coming back from the States is not seeing our kids. And you lot, our extended family, so we’re just over the moon to have a full house before the wedding on Sunday.\\nWhere we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia, setting off on this crazy thing called life. And of course, Innie and Leo, our new family.\\nWell, we’re just so grateful, not only for your incredible hospitality, but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.\\nSo as they say in our country, abondanza.\\nCheers!\\nNow baby.\\nWow!\\nWhat classes are you loving? Have you given any more thought to tort law? ‘Cause class action is really where it’s at right now. What does Jonathan say? He knows you pretty well. What does he think you should do?\\n[Bea] Mom.\\nOkay.\\nI can’t even remember why we put you in the truck again. We didn’t put her in the trunk, she stowed away in the trunk.\\nYeah, I wanted to go with you guys to see Cinderella.\\nWe were going to Coachella.\\nI know that now, it was nice.\\nAll right, everyone. So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy. Let’s just have a moment to calm ourselves. I am not looking at anybody in particular, but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.\\nCrown chakra.\\nLet’s hit that cobra.\\nCleanse, get that weasel.\\nOkay.\\nGo!\\nYou go, you go.\\nSign of the times.\\nAll right, all right, four words.\\nFirst word, the, A, of, if.\\nAnimosity, hate, liar.\\nFive words.\\n[Bea] No, just shut the fuck up.\\nThe Bible.\\nA woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality to take advantage of other people.\\nMom, focus, okay?

Just say the word.\\nIt’s on the extreme.\\nGrumpy old man.\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nOkay, okay, yeah, okay.\\n[Bea] Fuck boy.\\nOld cat woman.\\n[Bea] Your ego.\\nOkay.\\nWhat is this?\\n[Bea] Wait, no props.\\nNo one cares, no one can see us.\\n[Bea] Cheaters are shocking.\\nSays the woman who cheated on her fiance.\\n[Bea] We were on a break, asshole.\\nYou’re either broken up for good, or you’re cheating. Either way, someone’s lying to someone.\\n[Bea] I must have really gotten under your skin.\\nRoger, what is this?\\nFat, five.\\nWhat is the thing I’m holding in my hand?\\nFireworks.\\nFireworks by Katy Perry.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] That is not fair.\\nHey, what, you’re not fair. What’s wrong with you? Just stop.\\n[Bea] What are you doing?\\nWhat is wrong with you?\\n[Bea] Stop.\\nOh God.\\nOh God.\\nSam, what the?\\nOh my God.\\nAli.\\nGet back.\\nSam.\\nRoger.\\nI’ve got this.\\nThat’s some gangster shit right there.\\nSorry.\\n[Bea] Sorry.\\n\\nThey’re going to ruin our wedding.\\nAll that matters is that we’re together.\\nIt’s true.\\nLook baby, I love you to the moon and back, but those two fuckwads are going to destroy our weekend, and our memories, which we are going to have for a very long time, are headed straight over a cliff.\\nIt’s going to be fine baby, we just have to. to stand there and profess our love.\\nIt seems to me, their animus only surfaced after they spent a night together. Am I accurate?\\nThat’s usually how it goes, honey.\\nWe crumple our feelings into a ball and shove ’em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.\\nThe solution appears to be simple then. We return them to the night they were spent.\\nLike we trick them into falling in love with each other?\\nHe didn’t say anything about love, honey. We just need to get them to jump each other’s bones.\\n\\nYeah, come on!\\nThat was good, right?\\nThat was good.\\nYou go, you go, you go, you go, you go.\\nShe clearly has eyes for Ben.\\nWho does, father?\\nHallie Spence, the sister. The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.\\nYou can’t say that. What the hell?\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that was rude. I apologize to anyone that was listening, which can only be you, Pete, ’cause you’re the only person that was listening. I apologize.\\nI accept your apology and will now move on. Do you know Bea’s been in love with Ben since the first night they met?\\nWell, why didn’t she tell him? You know, when I was a young bloke and I liked a girl, I would sneak up behind her and I’d cut a lock of her hair and then I’d smack her on the bum!\\nWhat the hell?\\nI don’t know, I’m not good at this, sorry.\\nBea was just too scared to tell him, but I’ve talked to her and she says she regrets walking out that morning.\\nTell me more, son.\\nWhy me?\\nBecause you’re really good at it, right? You can do it.\\nWhy me, why? Why you put this hat on me? No one can see me, it’s a radio play, motherfucker. Bea wants us to tell him how much she likes him, so he lets his guard down and goes to her. Some Cupid’s killed with arrows and some with traps.\\nThat was good, I like that, that’s good.\\nI just made it up.\\nSo, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers, and say, “Come to Papa.”\\nWhat are you doing?\\nI’m from a different generation.\\nAnd your generation sucks. You fucked up the whole world for us.\\nAnd I’m full of shame. But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.\\nBut Ben feels awful that he called her a disaster. I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.\\nThen why is he fighting with her?\\nWell, because he likes her.\\nAnd I know that Bea likes Ben. She’s just denying herself because she’s got in her head somehow that she’ll never love again.\\nWhoa, I’m not talking about love, baby. I’m talking about dick.\\nOh, it’s Ben.\\nOh.\\nHey. You.\\n[Bea] Oh God, they got to you too?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia say how much I like you?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really?\\nIt was Pete and Roger.\\n[Bea] Fantastic, it’s a team effort. They’re trying to get us together.\\nNo way.\\n[Bea] Come here.\\nOh, maybe they want us to stop acting like assholes so we don’t ruin the biggest event of their lives.\\n[Bea] Us? There is no us and assholes. You’re the one who destroyed the living room.\\nWould you two mind helping me with something? I hate to ask, but I’d really appreciate it.\\nSure.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\n\\nSo Roger left his sunglasses on the sailboat. I swear, if his head wasn’t screwed on, we’d use it as a bowling ball. Do me a favor and swim out and get them. It’s the one on the right.\\nBoth of us.\\n[Bea] Is that really a two person job?\\nDoesn’t seem like it.\\nYou two. Yeah.\\n[Bea] All right, so everyone’s involved in this.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] I feel bad.\\nMe too.\\n[Bea] I don’t want to bum Holly and Claudia out.\\nJust me and you.\\n[Bea] Can you not swim?\\nI’m an excellent swimmer.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of breath?\\nI’m fine. How much further do you think?\\n[Bea] Are your eyes closed?\\nI think it’s dark.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of shape? You have like a 10 pop.\\nI’m not out of shape. I’ve been to 295, 300 once. I just don’t do cardio.\\n[Bea] Oh my God, you’re hot girl fit.\\nI’m not hot girl fit.\\n[Bea] Okay, my bad. We’ll see you at the boat.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nI could have done it myself, but whatever. Thanks.\\n[Bea] No fucking way.\\nHoney, look who’s here.\\n[Bea] I cannot believe they did this.\\nWho is that?\\n[Bea] That is my ex, Jonathan.\\nHey, hey.\\nWhat is he doing here?\\n[Bea] My Black Hawk helicopter parents have been trying to get us back together for the past four months.\\nThey flew him halfway across the world to your sister’s wedding? That’s some deep off shit. They came to play.\\n[Bea] That’s my parents. They think I’m throwing my life away.\\nHoney, we’re just gonna take him back and get him all settled in.\\nI’ll see you later.\\n[Bea] You know, maybe we should do it. Just tell everyone we’re together.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] It would solve that problem for me and that problem for you.\\nI don’t have a problem.\\n[Bea] You clearly want Margaret.\\nNo, I don’t.\\n[Bea] Yes, you do. I saw the way you looked at her last night and I know she broke your heart. She sees you’re with me. She wants what she can’t have and then bye bye crocodile Jack. Fuck, he’s fast.\\nMaking her jealous is not gonna work. We’re not in seventh grade.\\n[Bea] Trust me, bro. We’re all in seventh grade when it comes to this stuff. They’ve already gone through all of the bullshit trying to trick us into each other’s arms. Let’s just embrace it.\\nThere’s no way we can convince anyone we actually like each other.\\n[Bea] Yeah, you’re right.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] You know, I still think about that night we spent together.\\nShut up.\\n[Bea] No, I’m serious. You know, this could be kind of fun. We’re at a wedding a million miles away from home. Who knows what could happen under the cover of a masquerade. And that night at your place, no matter how it ended, it was still pretty amazing. … Convincing enough?\\nFuck it. Let’s do it. … Just wait. Wait.\\nOkay, okay. Whoever wants to go on the hike, we need to leave now. We’re running behind schedule.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nBabe, the mountains have been there for millions of years. A few more minutes isn’t gonna hurt them.\\nBaby, I know you are trying to calm me down and I love you for it. Thank you. But I am hurting cats right now and I need some help instead of this easy breezy Martin Scorsese.\\nAw, jitters. Remember our wedding?\\nOnly that you’re the most beautiful bride on God’s green earth.\\nRight answer.\\nWe’re coming, we’re coming, we’re coming.\\nJinx, you owe me a cup.\\nOh, you have a little something in your teeth.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.\\nYeah, let me just take that out.\\nOh, I gotta get it out.\\nOh, it’s right there.\\nGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.\\nHoney, here he is.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] Jonathan.\\nSo nice to see you.\\n[Bea] I had no idea you were coming.\\nSo your parents didn’t tell you, okay? Yeah, you know, the first thing I asked them when they invited me was, “Does B know?” ‘Cause otherwise this would be really fucking awkward. And now it is fucking awkward.\\nNo, no, not at all.\\nI’m in a lot of love.\\nNo, you’re like family. It’d be effing awkward if you weren’t here.\\nI’m so glad you’re here.\\nI’m so happy for you two. Hey, congratulations.\\nYeah, thanks.\\nRight?\\n[Bea] It’s great to see you.\\nIt’s great to see you too.\\nWe’re all going on a hike, so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out. Let’s move out.\\n[Bea] Ben, meet Jonathan.\\nOh, hey, man.\\nI’m Ben.\\nHey, oh, Pete and Claudia’s friend, right?\\nAlso friends with Bea, among other things.\\nYeah, it’s nice to meet you.\\nOkay, plenty of enough time in the car to do whatever the fuck this is. Come on, let’s go!\\nYeah, okay. Yeah.\\n[Bea] We need to come up with a game plan.\\nYeah, you are so terrible at this.\\n[Bea] What?\\nWe’re doing this thing!\\nHoney, I’m sorry. I know we should have asked you, but we had to invite you.\\nOh, it’s totally fine. I’m glad he’s here. I love him and Holly loves him.\\nReally?\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nGreat, okay. So we’re spending a little time together away from the real world and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, Mom, guys, no. I totally forgot to tell you, but I’m with Ben. … Do you want to come?\\nI think I’m going to hang back and yell at your parents. Have fun.\\n\\nAlright, so is it like we just got together or we’ve been sneaking around? Oh, I got it. What if we ran into each other at Chipotle, lady in the tramp, the burrito?\\n[Bea] No.\\nThis can’t be that hard.\\n[Bea] It’s harder than you think. My parents don’t even believe it yet.\\nYou told them five seconds ago.\\n[Bea] They know I would never go out with a guy like you.\\nYou’ve been with one guy your entire life.\\n[Bea] Jonathan’s a better man than you’ll ever be.\\nAnd yet you left him. Which is why exactly? Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.\\n[Bea] Okay, you don’t know my boxes and you never will. Just figure this out, please.\\nOkay. We just suck face in front of everybody. Half of them think they set us up anyway.\\n[Bea] No, that’s too much. We need to do something that’s more hidden so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.\\nYou’re calling me a fuckboy like it’s an insult? I own that shit.\\n[Bea] Let’s just be affectionate. I know it’s a foreign concept for you.\\nI can be affectionate. I’ll affectionate the shit out of you.\\nI can’t believe your parents invited Jonathan. Now I have to find a table to sit him at.\\nWhat about Bea?\\nNo, no, she’s fine. She’s sitting with us at our table.\\nNo, I’m talking about how she’s already at a low point because she’s going through a breakup and I don’t even know what’s happening with school. She never even talks about it anymore.\\nI guess I could put up with the cousins.\\nWhy?\\nYou alright?\\nOh, shit.\\nWow.\\nCheck it out, guys!\\nNice!\\nYeah!\\nBeautiful!\\nSee, I told you it was going to be good.\\nMan, that’s nice.\\n[Bea] Oh, wow.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] So beautiful.\\nThere it is.\\nFeel the serenity.\\nPretty spectacular, hey?\\nIt’s amazing.\\n[Bea] Alright, your turn.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] This is just so romantic.\\nOkay, nuzzle my neck.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nGet in there. Damn, you are short.\\n[Bea] You are not tall enough to say that.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Oh, are you ticklish?\\nNo, I’m acting.\\n[Bea] Like a toddler?\\nNo, go away. Okay, I can use that.\\n[Bea] Beg me. Beg me to stuff you in the butt.\\nStop! Just let me do it. Permission to put my left hand on your right buttock.\\n[Bea] Granted. Too hard.\\nSorry. You gotta sell it.\\n[Bea] Okay, not in circles. It’s not a magic lamp.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Okay, now you’re just playing bop it.\\nI’ve never rubbed a bopper show.\\n[Bea] Clearly, you’ve tried. Are you not wearing underwear?\\nIt’s a swimsuit. I’m on holiday.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nOkay, just mind the gap.\\n[Bea] How’s that?\\nThat’s good. Just like, but you don’t have to hover. Just kind of, oh, man the woods.\\n[Bea] I’m sorry.\\nOkay, just take it out.\\n[Bea] You try.\\nYou want me to stick my finger in my own ass? How’s that gonna convince? Oh, on you. I can’t. Jesus Christ, it’s like a vacuum pack down here. How’d you get in this thing? Oh, man, it’s tight. Oh, see, it’s like holding a baby bird.\\n[Bea] God damn it.\\nWere they not watching this whole time?\\n[Bea] You like a mole or something on your butt?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really? ‘Cause I feel something.\\nI don’t have a mole. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Are there any more on me?\\n[Bea] I don’t know.\\nJack, spiders hunt bears. They hunt bears.\\nNo pictures. Put the cameras down. We’re not gonna take a spirit.\\nAre there any more?\\n[Bea] I don’t know.\\nWhere are they? I feel it. I feel it.\\n[Bea] I think I see something.\\nWhat do you see? What do you see?\\n[Bea] Oh, no, that’s just a part of you. You’re fine.\\nAll right, look, if I have one of those little fuckers in me, they might be in you.\\n[Bea] I’m good.\\nThat’s probably a better way to check than what I did.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nAll right, little one, we join your journey. We do not inherit the earth. We just borrow it from our creatures.\\nHey, guys. What did we miss?\\nWow.\\n\\nWhy can’t I get this?\\nBecause you’re meant to learn to dive when you’re six.\\nYou got this, hon.\\nYou ever try focusing on your toes? My mom taught me this trick. If you pretend like there’s a string from your nose to your toes, you just kind of maintain that position. You mind doing it again? This time I’m going to shout out a tribute question. I think it’s just going to help clear your mind.\\nJust make sure it’s a question about airplanes or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\\nOkay, um, uh, what company created the Concorde?\\nA collaboration between British Airways and the French government. How’d I do?\\nYou’re good there.\\nMaybe your mom can teach him how to dive.\\nShe passed away.\\nOh, I’m so sorry.\\nYeah, sorry.\\nAll right, I’m going to go again, but this time give me one with a little shorter answer.\\nI have a better idea. You just let me do everything, I’ll guide you in. Don’t think.\\nBe careful of his shoulder.\\nYeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.\\nWouldn’t let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.\\nI had to tell her I love her. When you know she’s the one, nothing else matters.\\nI’m waving, thank you, thank you.\\nThere you go.\\nDid I do it?\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Good job, babe.\\nYour dad’s a natural.\\n[Bea] I’m so glad you guys got to spend some time with Ben.\\nAre you two really…\\n…getting to know each other in a very respectful manner? One befitting such a kind and intelligent woman as your daughter.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are in the early stages.\\nNot too early.\\n[Bea] But also not so advanced.\\nJust that magical moment when two people come together in this crazy journey we call life.\\n[Bea] That’s why I was so worried when Jonathan showed up. I don’t want to hurt his feelings.\\nI even suggested we hide our light under a bushel for his sake.\\n[Bea] But our love is just so strong. And I know what you guys are thinking. He’s much older.\\nThey weren’t, right? Probably thinking I’m 27, early 28s.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are very happy.\\nHappiest.\\n[Bea] Yep.\\nYou know, you looked like that back in the day.\\nNo, I didn’t. That guy’s made out of cobblestone.\\nThey’re holding hands.\\nI think it’s working.\\nI can’t believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.\\n[Bea] Was that bullshit about your mom?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] The story about the giant wrench. I thought it might have been a lie until all your one night nothings.\\nYou ever heard that too?\\n[Bea] Like, I didn’t mean… I’m sorry. And it wasn’t a lie.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so nice to my dad. You should probably rinse off. You have his SPF a billion on you now.\\nCheers, mate. I’ll just grab a quickie.\\nOkay.\\nSo, Australia. What do you reckon, eh? How you finding it?\\nI don’t know. It’s great.\\nMaz goes on about you all the time. Ripper Cunt, she calls you.\\nMaz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is…\\nGood friend. Oh, yeah. You know you had a proper surf when sand gets all up your clacker. And your gobbler, too.\\nGobbler is…\\nYou know, your hog bonnet. You know, your beef cap. Come on, mate. You know, the anteater. Anyway, good to have ya. Gotcha.\\nG’day, love.\\nHey, mate. Fancy a game?\\n[Bea] You’re going down. How have you been doing?\\nPretty good. You?\\n[Bea] Okay, I guess.\\nHow’s school going? Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?\\n[Bea] You know me. I’ve never been one for practicing.\\nStill having second thoughts?\\n[Bea] Straight to third.\\nI know it’s weird, me being here, but believe me, I had nothing to do with it. Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.\\n[Bea] That’s sweet. You’re part of the family.\\nI’d be lying if I said I haven’t been thinking about you.\\n[Bea] Yeah, me too.\\nHow long have you and that guy, Ben, been?\\n[Bea] It’s kind of new. Not like new, new, but newish.\\nWell, I think he seems great.\\n[Bea] No, you don’t.\\nI really don’t.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so cool about all of this. Not just this, but this too.\\nIt’s really good to see you, Bea.\\n[Bea] I’m glad you’re here. Now let’s have fun.\\nLet’s do it.\\nMate.\\nThat’s me.\\nYou want a coffee? It’s the best in the world.\\nYou guys are really proud of your coffee here.\\nIt’s the best in the fucking world.\\nOkay.\\nEnjoy.\\nFuck, that is good.\\nI was thinking of going for a bit of a run later. Do you want to join?\\nI’m actually going on a bike ride with Bea, so I don’t think I can.\\nShe’s a little sweet on you, hey?\\nOh, you caught that.\\nHow long have you and Beau been together?\\nNah, we’re just banging about. He’s nice, but I think I’m looking for someone less casual. More romantic.\\nWow.\\nWhy did me and you ever break up anyway?\\nI don’t really remember, but I think you said something like I was an immature, drongo, smothered in ex body spray.\\nSmells like you’re not that guy anymore. Bea’s a lucky girl.\\nOh.\\nHey, open the door. Bea.\\n[Bea] What’s wrong?\\nMargaret thinks we’re together.\\n[Bea] That’s great.\\nNo, Margaret needs to think we’re the right type of together. Not together together, but like situationally together. ‘Cause if she thinks we’re together together, she’s not gonna break girl code. So we need to finesse our togetherness so that we’re together, but there’s an opening for our togetherness and she can just slide right in so that we can be together.\\n[Bea] Are you on Coke?\\nNo, it’s like coffee here. It’s like meth. I’m guessing. No, I’m not. I worked at Goldman. Partner’s wedding. Do what you do.\\n[Bea] Jesus, dude, who are you?\\nI’m a man trying to figure this out. Look at your room, it’s so much bigger. You got a painting? Wow, that’s so red. We have to kick it up a notch. Make it feel like we’re in the Gaga stage.\\n[Bea] What do you wanna do, take me in the hallway?\\nThat is not Gaga. Actually, that could be construed as Gaga. Tonight’s the rehearsal dinner, so we have to do something that makes it look like you’re into me, but you’re not into me. And I’m into you, but you can tell by my face that it’s never gonna mount.\\n[Bea] Get it together, man.\\nYou hit me so much.\\n\\nOkay, Kalana, now pretend this is a real fox that messed up our garden. Fuck it up. Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up. Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up. Fuck it up. Ooh. You see that?\\nHe did it, yeah. Oh, hey, they’re here. All right, everybody, wheels up.\\nHustle up.\\nBad dog.\\nYou look cute.\\nBaby, you look so good.\\nShe’s has been.\\nYou look so good.\\nYeah, I look bad.\\nMan, this is the best time to say that.\\nDaddy’s a dad.\\nCome on, let’s go.\\nYeah.\\nAll right, let’s do it.\\nThank you.\\nYou see the size of that boat?\\nHey, guys.\\nWoo!\\n[Bea] Nice touch.\\nNice dress.\\nYou have a good heart.\\nI love this dress.\\nYou look fine.\\nOh, thank you.\\nWhat would you like to drink?\\nWhat’s a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?\\nThree scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.\\nOh, thank you.\\nAll right.\\nYou remembered.\\nThat you can’t handle hard liquor? Yeah, the smell’s still not out of my car.\\nYou know I feel really bad about that. That was a fun night. That was a fun summer.\\nMarks! Marks, captain says that we can steer the ship.\\nOh, okay, I’m coming. Hang on, I’ve got heels on.\\nLook how lucky we are. On a boat sailing back and forth with no real transportation or reason.\\nOkay.\\nAnd look at you, Polly Pocket. You the belle of the boat.\\nHe didn’t remember me.\\nOh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?\\nNo, honey, that’s, yes, I think it might be. Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.\\nThere it is.\\nWell, at least that was subtle.\\n[Bea] Was it?\\nThis oddly reminds me of prom.\\n[Bea] The first or second time?\\nJonathan is just the most perfect guy.\\nHe’s like a son to us.\\nWell, that might be a problem, mate. They might not wanna shag a brother.\\nSo how’s it going? Can parents back off a little?\\n[Bea] How about you?\\nGame on.\\n[Bea] Can you even dance?\\nYou just let me lead.\\n[Bea] Oh, God.\\nLet’s go.\\nIs Margaret watching?\\nIt’s a little hard to tell what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.\\nEverybody to the top deck, we about to do a champagne toast.\\n[Bea] Come with me.\\nSo what are we doing?\\n[Bea] Closing the deal. Titanic me.\\nWhat?\\nOh, help yourself to some champagne.\\nOh, thank you.\\nGrab some drinks.\\nOh, great.\\nNice.\\n[Bea] Titanic me.\\nNo, that is so lame.\\n[Bea] Exactly. The only people who would do something this lame are the ones who know how lame it is, but are in the first stages of liking each other, so they’re totally comfortable in their mutual lameness. Toast me.\\nOh my God.\\n[Bea] Come on.\\nThis is so cringe. So is saying cringe, old man.\\n[Bea] Lift my arms.\\nI’ve seen the movie.\\n[Bea] Have you?\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nThis is never gonna work.\\nAww! That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!\\nAre they doing Titanic?\\nAww!\\n[Bea] Are they watching?\\nYep.\\n[Bea] Are they buying it?\\nCan’t imagine they would.\\nIt’s real. We did it.\\nWe’re good. We’re really bloody good.\\nJonathan, have you seen Tasmania?\\nInya, I’m fine. It’s fine.\\nCan I do the line? That’s king of the world. You’re king of the world.\\n[Bea] Jack, I’m flying!\\nOkay, we can stop there.\\nWe can stop there.\\nThey’re gone. Show’s over.\\nOh my god!\\n[Bea] No! Wait for me! Help! Wait! Wait!\\nBae! Bea! Are you okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Why’d you jump in?\\nTo save you!\\n[Bea] But you’re a terrible swimmer!\\nI’m a great swimmer! Just short distances.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna die.\\nWe’re not gonna die.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna get hypothermia.\\nThe water’s 90 degrees.\\n[Bea] We’re gonna get eaten by sharks. Fuck! We’re gonna get eaten by sharks!\\nWe are gonna be fine. And we spent ten hours shredding water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.\\n[Bea] Goldman?\\nYeah, it was a partner’s kids bar mitzvah. A little bit of crack.\\nOh my god!\\nRoger!\\nOh my god!\\nIt looks like they’re going full Titanic. I love the commitment!\\nStop the boat!\\nNo, no, no.\\nHelp!\\nThey’re coming!\\nStay calm!\\nThis is not a very good swim.\\nBei!\\nThere.\\n[Bea] Are you sure?\\nYeah. Come on.\\nWhy aren’t we turning the boat around?\\nWe are in too shallow of water. We’ll run aground.\\nBut harbour rescue has been notified.\\nCome on.\\nAre you good?\\n[Bea] Mm-hmm.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] All right. Okay.\\nLet’s go.\\n[Bea] All right, get in the row.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] That was, um, probably the most– I mean, if you didn’t close it with Margaret, I don’t– There’s nothing more romantic than jumping in to save me.\\nYeah, well, Jonathan didn’t do it, that’s for sure. Your parents half the clock, that’s shit.\\n[Bea] You didn’t even give him a chance.\\nWhy do you keep defending this guy? Why do you break up with him in the first place?\\n[Bea] It’s complicated.\\nIt’s never complicated. What, he cheated on you? Drug problem? Did you catch him measuring his dick with a ruler app?\\n[Bea] We never fought.\\nIsn’t that a good thing?\\n[Bea] It was just comfortable. And he’s a great guy, which means there’s no one out there for me because I had the best one. I couldn’t even tell him I quit law school. And I have no idea what I’m gonna do with my life. We’re gonna get eaten by sharks, I had to tell somebody.\\nNo one else knows?\\n[Bea] I don’t think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.\\nYou finally did it.\\n[Bea] What?\\nYou know, one night you said you didn’t want to be a lawyer anyways.\\n[Bea] You remember that?\\nIt was a memorable night, until you snuck out, of course. Why did you?\\n[Bea] Because you scared the shit out of me. It was the first time in my life that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.\\nI know a little bit about that. I was really hurt when you left. So I said all that terrible stuff about you to Pete. That’s not how I felt.\\n[Bea] Look at us. Just a couple of fucked up people floating in the middle of the harbor. Promise me if we make it out alive we’ll go see that from dry land.\\nIt’s a pretty killer view from here.\\n[Bea] It’s dumb but I want to see the people. Landmarks like those are full of people in love. Marriage proposals, honeymooners, romantics jumping off of moving trains just to see the building with the person they love.\\nLike your dad in the Eiffel Tower?\\n[Bea] He told you that?\\nNothing else matters when it comes to love.\\n[Bea] You could use a bit of that right now.\\nIt’s not dumb. You, me and the opera house. It’s a date. I promise.\\n[Bea] What’s wrong?\\nI’m a little afraid of flying.\\n[Bea] Don’t you fly all the time for your job?\\nI have a very specific routine. I mask, headphones, build my bubble.\\nThat’s my Serenity song. How do you know my Serenity song?\\n[Bea] Don’t worry about it.\\n[Bea] You all good?\\nShut the fuck up now!\\nThanks again.\\nStay out of the water, yeah?\\nWant some coffee?\\n[Bea] Not the stuff from here. I’ll be up all night.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Thanks for kind of saving me though.\\nIt was fun.\\n[Bea] Stupid, but fun.\\nWell, that’s the best kind.\\n\\nNo, no, no, it’s hot!\\n[Bea] I’m warm.\\nWhen are you ever gonna learn? Like, you want me to blow on it? … Is it still hot?\\nWe’re getting pretty good at faking it.\\n[Bea] I don’t even know what’s real anymore. Everything I do just feels like a mistake.\\nBen, Steve, are you guys all right?\\nBen, wait, you hear?\\nI can’t hear you.\\nSteve!\\nBeatrice! Beatrice!\\n\\nHoney, what are these? Is that a handprint?\\nNo.\\nCome on, baby gorgeous. We got chores. Come on, let’s go. Ben, are you ready? We got groom stuff to do.\\nDude, I’m coming, I’m coming.\\nMan, I hope you scrub from top to bottom, ’cause who knows what was in that heart rate.\\nI also showered last night.\\nTwo showers in eight hours? Go off, King, get clean!\\n[Bea] Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?\\nYes, I’m so excited to marry Claudia. But, you know, I’m also hosting a party where it feels like we’re all playing parts in a play, and I’m not really into the pageantry, and I kinda just wanna do a little–\\n[Bea] All that matters is that you and Claudia run for the rest of your lives together.\\nI love you.\\n[Bea] I love you too.\\nBae? Hey, you’re still good to get the cake, right?\\n[Bea] Yes, ma’am.\\nAwesome. I put Margaret on it with you, just to be safe.\\n[Bea] Margaret.\\n\\nAll right, talk to me, baby. Who’s it gonna be, Margaret or Bae?\\nCome on, man, don’t give me that.\\nWe’re just two girls talking. I get it, though. It’s tough. Magpie’s your dream girl. She’s confident, beautiful, and she knows how to put out a fire with her attire. Now Bae’s waxing her other hand. Whoo! She’s smart, funny, quick, and she got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of.\\nPeter.\\nWhat? I’m not objectifying Margaret, man. That’d be inappropriate. That’s my cousin.\\nIt’s inappropriate with Bae too.\\nThis is deeper than I thought. Hey, Sydney! My boy is in love!\\nStop, dude, just stop.\\nWhat?\\nI know what you’re doing. I know what you’ve all been doing. You set us up, and we went along with it. But it’s fake.\\nIt was my stepdad, right? He can’t act for shit.\\nYou suck too, bro.\\nThat’s foul, dog. It’s definitely gotta be Bae, man.\\nI don’t know, man. I don’t fucking know. She doesn’t know what she wants. She’s single for basically the first time in her life. She just quit law school. Her fucking fiancé’s here.\\nMan, stop with all the white boy–\\nWhat the–\\nHey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Seriously. Anytime something gets real, you run away, call yourself a fuckboy, make an excuse, and you just move on to the next. It’s Bae. You jumped off a boat for her.\\nOh, that’s perfect.\\n[Bea] They’re gonna love it. Thank you so much.\\nLet me get this boxed up for you.\\nThank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nI don’t get all the pageantry of weddings. If you like someone, give ’em a snog. Keep it to yourselves.\\n[Bea] I wore a wedding dress for Halloween for five years in a row.\\nStop it.\\n[Bea] No, I know. It’s so pathetic. But I am with you now. This is not for me.\\nSo you and Ben aren’t serious?\\n[Bea] What? No, no, it’s just… we’re just situationally together.\\n‘Cause when I saw you last night in the harbor, I thought it might be more with you two.\\n[Bea] Just…situationally.\\nIs that an American thing?\\n[Bea] I don’t even know.\\nSo you’re right if I have a go at him, then? I feel like I might have made a mistake letting him loose. If that’s not okay, just tell me. For real.\\n[Bea] I know he really likes you.\\n\\nHow do you think I should play this with Ben? Should I wait until after the wedding?\\n[Bea] Um…I don’t know.\\nHave you guys hooked up?\\nHey.\\nWe’re Beatrice.\\nYou quit school?\\nYou’re just gonna pour gasoline on everything you’ve worked for?\\nIs there still time to re-enroll?\\nSoon as you broke up with Jonathan, everything turned to pot. Are you on drugs? Because at least then I’d understand.\\n[Bea] Who told you I quit law school? Was it Ben?\\nYou quit school?\\nWhat?\\nWhen were you gonna tell us?\\nIs this to get back at us? I’m sorry if we pushed you to succeed your whole life. We’re such awful parents.\\n[Bea] Mom, this isn’t about you.\\nYes it is. It is about us. And no, we’re not gonna let you throw away your life because you’re going through something. Everyone is always going through something. It’s called life.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] I can’t believe you. You told him I quit school?\\nNo, I didn’t.\\nYou told Pete. Pete told us.\\nShit.\\nI told you what?\\nYeah, no, I told Pete, but I didn’t mean it like that.\\nTold me what?\\nThat we’re gonna find out at some point.\\n[Bea] That’s not for you to decide.\\nI’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.\\nIt doesn’t matter how we found out.\\nFound out what?\\nShe quit law school.\\nOh, yeah, I knew that.\\n[Bea] You’re real shit.\\nI made a mistake. I’m sorry.\\n[Bea] There’s a reason why you’re alone. No one can trust you.\\nYeah, what’s your reason?\\n[Bea] Guys like you.\\nKeep telling yourself that.\\n[Bea] Fuck off.\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. Don’t do this right here, right now. I messed this all up. It’s all on me.\\nWhy don’t we all go for a swim, eh? Cool off before the wedding?\\nThat’s a great idea. Maybe early drinks?\\n[Bea] Guys, I am so sorry, but your plan is all ruined. We are not together. We were faking it the whole time.\\nYou knew?\\nWhat are they even talking about?\\nWell, we may have orchestrated a union between the pair of them in order for peace to prevail across the land.\\nYou lied to us? What have you been honest about lately?\\nSo you lied to me too? You’re not together?\\n[Bea] I could never be with someone like him.\\nYeah, ’cause I’m the one who fucked it up.\\n[Bea] You did fuck it up.\\nI fucked it up?\\n[Bea] Yeah, you fucked it up.\\nI fucked it up?\\n[Bea] You fucked it up.\\nOh, no.\\nBad dog, Kalonofin.\\nI mean, good dog, you killed that shit, but next time read the room, Kaymoney.\\n[Bea] I am so sorry.\\nHey, uh…\\nBae.\\nI think he’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine.\\n\\nGood?\\nYou’re perfect.\\nRelax, you’re working yourself up.\\nIt is not fine. It is not everything. It is fine. Okay, all we asked of them was to come out here, celebrate us, and they are ruining it.\\nAnd all week and I have been so stressed, and you’ve been more worried about what’s going on with bae than with me.\\nWell, you’ve been more concerned about your planning. Are you marrying me or your itinerary?\\nWell, if that’s how you feel, then why are we even doing this?\\nI don’t know. You tell me.\\n\\nThere’s one last thing we need to fake.\\nClaudia, Allie, we’re assholes.\\nWe’re really sorry.\\nI’m a terrible sister, and he’s a terrible friend.\\nIt’s your guys’ big day.\\nWe’re not gonna mess it up, we promise.\\nUh-huh, but just so you both know,\\nif you fuck up today, the something I borrowed\\nis a knife, and it’s shiny and new.\\nLove is intoxicating.\\nIt envelops you, it tickles you,\\nand it makes you feel like you can walk on air.\\nIt’s like this wind.\\nIt’s in your bones, it’s in your breath,\\nit’s in every beat of your heart.\\nYou can’t look for it, you can’t describe it,\\nand you can’t escape it.\\nAllie, I love you so much,\\nand I don’t think I say it enough.\\nYou are the yin to my yang,\\npeanut butter to my jelly,\\nand I will love you forever and always.\\nClaudia, I love you with so much of my heart\\nthat none is left to protest.\\nThat’s very good.\\nJust made it up.\\nA lot of it.\\nI now pronounce you married!\\nYeah!\\nOh, look, there she is.\\nOh, hey, parents.\\nIs that Tasmania?\\nYeah.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI am so sorry I lied to you guys about school.\\nI didn’t want to disappoint you guys again.\\nWell, if you’d just told us, maybe we could have–\\nTrying to talk me out of it?\\nNo, maybe we could have supported you.\\nI know this is scary for you guys.\\nYeah, it’s scary for me too,\\nand I gotta figure it out on my own.\\nI know that every now and then\\nwe might come off as a little…\\nControlling?\\nNo.\\nOverbearing?\\nNo.\\nActually crazy?\\nYes.\\nThat’s it, but only because we love you so much.\\nLove you.\\nGood luck.\\nGood luck.\\nHi, Aunt.\\nYes?\\nDo you mind if I steal a hand?\\nUh, not at all.\\nGo ahead.\\nHigh five.\\nHey.\\nHi.\\nWhere’s Bo?\\nHe buggered off.\\nHe said he saw a wave he couldn’t morally not surf.\\nI’m sorry.\\nIt was never really anything.\\nAnd you and Bea.\\nShe said you were just situational.\\nShe said that?\\nAre you good?\\nYeah, we know it’s been a tough weekend for you.\\nI don’t know.\\nThese last few days really made me realize how much I miss you.\\nWhy don’t you just go for a walk?\\nFigure your head.\\nYeah, we’ll go with you.\\nNo, we won’t.\\nNo.\\nI love you, but this is our wedding.\\nSo…\\nAre you sure?\\nYeah.\\nI might go and do some people watching.\\nJust not… these people.\\nThank you.\\nWow.\\nBen.\\nI wanted this for so long.\\nBut I think I’m just holding on to a memory.\\nAnd also, I… I’m sorry.\\nI’m so sorry.\\nI’ve never seen Bea like this before.\\nReally?\\nYou were the one who said there’s a thin line between love and hate.\\nYou’re always the first person to say that bit, you know?\\nI know it sounds crazy, but even when they were yapping at each other, I’ve never seen Bea happier.\\nSame with Ben.\\nHey, stepfather, may I have a word?\\nYes, but make it quick, son.\\nI promised my lady a dance, but don’t tell your mother.\\nYou’re so clever.\\nYou know who’s also clever?\\nBen.\\nYou know who else would be perfect for Ben?\\nThat mumbly girl who always looks like she’s got a secret.\\nYou know her name is Bea.\\nThat was a callback.\\nWill you stop?\\nStop.\\nHow you going, mate? How you going, Ben?\\nWhat, you two?\\nWhat?\\nJust enough with the loud talking and the overhearing.\\nJust stop.\\nBro, we literally didn’t know you were standing there.\\nYeah, it’s true. We didn’t know you were listening.\\nWe did.\\nIt was greatly a performance for one.\\nAnd we nailed it, too.\\nWhat is with you people?\\nThis entire weekend, I have been lied to and manipulated and puppeteered.\\nI don’t know what is real and what is not.\\nMate, I know you’re a little blurry, but I meant what I said up there about love.\\nIt’s too precious a resource to be wasted.\\nI haven’t seen her. Is she, uh–\\nShe went on a walk a while ago.\\nAfter she saw you kissing Margaret.\\nWhat?\\nNo, I didn’t kiss Margaret.\\nMargaret kissed me. I backed up.\\nI don’t want to be with Margaret.\\nI want to–\\nStop it.\\nYou gorgeous idiot.\\nRun. Don’t wait on love.\\nFight for it.\\nAnd don’t worry about the age difference.\\nI’m 29.\\nHoney, no one’s 29.\\nDo you know where she went?\\nShe said she wanted to walk around, do some people watching.\\nThat’s what she said?\\nPeople watching?\\nI think it was more of a euphemism for crying alone.\\nNo, it’s not.\\nI think I know where she might be.\\nGood God, man, go get her.\\nScour the city block by block.\\nScan the grid.\\nFirst north, south, then east, west.\\nLeo, I know exactly where she is.\\nIt makes it a lot easier.\\nI just need to find my moving train.\\nWhat’s going on here?\\nIs that coffee?\\nYeah.\\nOh, wait.\\nCall harbor rescue!\\nOh, my God!\\nOh, my God!\\nWhat the hell? Are you crazy?\\nPlease ask a favor!\\nWhy don’t you just treat people like my folks?\\nJust go get the girl.\\nThank you!\\nExcuse me!\\nExcuse me!\\nI didn’t kiss Margaret. She kissed me.\\nI know that’s a bullshit excuse, but it’s true.\\nI couldn’t find a moving train.\\nSorry, it’s the best I could do.\\nAre you out of your mind?\\nYeah.\\nBecause it’s been two years since we met\\nand I haven’t spent every single day with you.\\nThat’s the sign of a crazy person.\\nI hated you.\\nI didn’t really give you a choice.\\nI definitely didn’t hate you.\\nYou called me a bitch.\\nI said you were acting like a bitch.\\nNo, I was a bitch.\\nThe way I handled everything.\\nThe way I handled the first night.\\nThe way I handled last night.\\nYeah, it wasn’t really awesome.\\nWhy did you leave?\\nI thought you were going to regret it.\\nAnd I couldn’t face the idea of losing someone else that I… I really loved.\\nLast night was the first thing I haven’t regretted in a long time.\\nI love the way we fight.\\nI love how smart you are.\\nI love the weird way you stick your hands down my pants.\\nAnd I love how you know what you don’t want.\\nAnd if it’s not me, if I don’t check all your boxes,\\nif I’m not the one, I get it.\\nThat would really, really fucking suck.\\nSo, you gonna kiss me now?\\nYeah, I am.\\nThat’s a lot of running for Mr. No Cardio.\\nYeah, I’m dying. I need some air.\\nHow do they know my Serenity song?\\nI’m sorry you almost called off your wedding because of all of our bullshit.\\nWhat?\\nWhat?\\nI saw you arguing on the porch.\\nOh, no, no, no, we staged a fake fight so you guys would feel bad and make up.\\nAre you marrying your precious itinerary or me?\\nWell, if that’s how you feel, I don’t know why we’re doing this anymore.\\nThank you very much.\\nPuppets.\\nWe’re just puppets.\\nYep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

metabolism\\nopen your books everyone\\nlet\\u2019s first talk about the anatomy of humans as things stand\\nbecause we currently need to drink water and consume food in order to survive we\\u2019ve wasted precious resources on people that do not serve the greater cause\\nto be frank we are weak and in our current world which is plagued by a shortage of water mankind needs to take a new stronger physical form\\nwe must develop a new metabolic system in order to breed humans that can survive for extended periods of dehydration and malnutrition thereby reversing the population decline and paving the way for civilization to be reborn\\nchildren in this harsh and unforgiving world always remind yourselves of dr yang gisu\\u2019s miracle and of your own responsibilities\\nour metabolism will improve through dr yang\\u2019s research and eventually mankind will finally be given a body which can adapt to this brave new world\\npay attention suna\\nit\\u2019s just odd\\nnobody even has enough to drink on the outside yet the people here are able to drink however much they want and even shower\\neveryone keeps going on and on about dr yang gisu\\nshouldn\\u2019t he be giving water to everybody out there who needs it\\n\\noh suna\\nthe outside world is full of barbarians\\nthe exact same type that killed yang gisu\\u2019s beloved daughter\\nin order to join the new humanity\\nyou need to be the right kind of person\\nwhat kind\\u2026 what kind of person is that\\n people that offer aid in furthering the doctor\\u2019s research\\ni wanna be a part of the research support\\nwell you sound like you have the right attitude juye no\\nsuna sure could learn a lot from you\\n yes ma\\u2019am\\n now then for our next lesson we\\u2019ll be learning about organisms that are best at surviving in the wild\\nwe\\u2019ll be getting a visit from dr yang gisu later so let\\u2019s all welcome him properly to show our gratitude\\n yes\\n\\n these rations are the fruits of your parents\\u2019 hard work as i\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all aware\\nlet us all dig in with a thankful heart\\nand there\\u2019s the water which is more valuable than anything else in this world\\nmake sure to drink it all down to the very last drop\\ndr yang gisu had it specially purified for all of you here\\njuye\\n hello everyone\\n alright a round of applause everyone\\nattention\\nbow\\n\\u201cstudents are our hope\\u201d\\ni\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all aware of our apartment\\u2019s motto right\\nthat\\u2019s the reason we\\u2019ve been supplying our students with a special diet\\n the world is beset by a shortage of food and water as you know\\ni\\u2019m working day and night to create a new world where humans are going to be able to survive and live a good life with only a minuscule amount of food and drinking water\\nbut until that day comes you all need to finish everything you\\u2019re given making sure not to waste any\\nyes\\nalright\\ndoctor we have someone very promising\\noh there\\nmmhmm she\\u2019s wonderful\\nher name\\n lee juye\\n lee juye right\\nyes\\nhi you\\u2019re \\nyeah\\ni heard you really

metabolismopen your books everyonelets first talk about the anatomy of humans as things standbecause we currently need to drink water and consume food in order to survive weve wasted precious resources on people that do not serve the greater causeto be frank we are weak and in our current world which is plagued by a shortage of water mankind needs to take a new stronger physical formwe must develop a new metabolic system in order to breed humans that can survive for extended periods of dehydration and malnutrition thereby reversing the population decline and paving the way for civilization to be rebornchildren in this harsh and unforgiving world always remind yourselves of dr yang gisus miracle and of your own responsibilitiesour metabolism will improve through dr yangs research and eventually mankind will finally be given a body which can adapt to this brave new worldpay attention sunaits just oddnobody even has enough to drink on the outside yet the people here are able to drink however much they want and even showereveryone keeps going on and on about dr yang gisushouldnt he be giving water to everybody out there who needs itoh sunathe outside world is full of

and who believe in human rights let our voices be heard in an absolutely clear way and not add the imprimatur of approval to the soviet union and its government while they have heavily armed invading forces in the freedomloving and innocent and deeply religious country of afghanistanand i hope recognition of a grateful nation will at least partially make up for the sacrifice that youll have to

Please, it\\u2019s an emergency.\\nCaramel latte for Miranda.\\nHoney, I\\u2019m about to order. Do you want your usual?\\n[Bea] Uh.\\nMy wife would like a double espresso although you\\u2019ve had trouble sleeping lately, right babe? Maybe we should back it off to a single. You kept the light on until like midnight last night.\\n[Bea] I did, didn\\u2019t I? Yeah, so maybe I\\u2019ll just have a peppermint tea with two sugars. Thanks, husband.\\nOh, and the bread. It\\u2019s grilled cheese night. And she is part of the purchasing class, so can we get the bathroom key? Thank you.\\n[Bea] Thank you. That was really nice.\\nHappy to. You knew a lot about bathroom law.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] It was a short chapter. Thank you.\\nOh. I\\u2019ll have your tea waiting for you. Can\\u2019t leave my wife.\\n[Bea] Oh. Okay. That\\u2019s great. I will see you on the other side.\\n\\n[Bea] Hallie, I just met this guy and I don\\u2019t know, it was something. Well, I know it\\u2019s been a while, but I\\u2019m pretty sure he bought me a tea and he might have just stolen my coat. But what do I do? Oh no, this is the time that I\\u2019m supposed to be meeting people and doing things. Hallie, I gotta call you back. God damn it.\\nAre you okay?\\n[Bea] Big time. I am big time okay. I just had to pee for like the last six hours and I just started this new internship. And I didn\\u2019t want to ask anyone where the bathroom was because I didn\\u2019t want them to think I was weak and not a problem solver.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. Every human does it. It\\u2019s very, very normal.\\nYeah.\\nPeppermint tea, two sugars.\\n[Bea] Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Hi.\\n[Bea] Thank you.\\nOh, hey. You\\u2026\\n[Bea] So are you going to ask me out now?\\nYeah. Yeah, I am. I\\u2019m Ben.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m Bea.\\n[Bea] So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, you would not be able to protect us?\\nNo, no. You\\u2019d be dead.\\n[Bea] You would let me die?\\nI\\u2019m not going to let you die. I\\u2019m just going to survive. You\\u2019re right. You\\u2019re right. You\\u2019re right.\\n[Bea] I was a gymnast.\\nGymnast?\\n[Bea] Yes. For like five years. I got like sixth place on beam.\\n\\n\\n\\nSixth place?\\n[Bea] Yes. Got a ribbon.\\nI\\u2019m impressed.\\n[Bea] Everybody gets a ribbon.\\nAll right, wait to cool down. You just saw me take it off the burning stove.\\n[Bea] Oh, my God.\\nIf you\\u2019re going to be a lawyer, you got to understand negligence and breach and McDonald\\u2019s versus that lady\\u2019s habeas corpus.\\n[Bea] You used none of those terms properly.\\nHow do you know? You\\u2019re not a lawyer yet. It\\u2019s not too late to choose a more noble profession.\\n[Bea] Oh, like you?\\nYou\\u2019re right. Stick with it. I\\u2019m going to need a lawyer at some point.\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t even know if I want to be a lawyer. I cannot believe I just said that out loud. I\\u2019m sorry. My life is a disaster right now.\\nMight be turning the corner. You just met me.\\n[Bea] Or I might end up in a suitcase. I mean, look at this place. It looks like every serial killer reenactment documentary. Why do you have a giant wrench?\\nOkay, it wouldn\\u2019t be a suitcase. It\\u2019d be a carry-on because you\\u2019re zero feet tall. And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how broken something is, there\\u2019s always a way to fix it. I\\u2019m sorry. I don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m talking to you about my mom right now.\\n[Bea] Alright. Then tell me about that.\\nThat is a long story. Everybody survived.\\n[Bea] Great.\\n[Bea] Holly, I don\\u2019t know this guy. He\\u2019s fucking great.\\nYo, let\\u2019s go, Benny. Come on, cupcake. We\\u2019re gonna be late.\\n\\u2018Sup, Pete.\\nNo way. You cooked? That girl you blew me off for stayed over?\\n[Bea] He asked me out and then I kind of asked him out and then we just walked around the city and we fell asleep talking. I don\\u2019t\\u2013 I left before you could wake up. I don\\u2019t know why. Why did I? What the fuck am I doing? Okay, I love you. Bye. I\\u2019m so sorry I woke you up. I didn\\u2019t\\u2013 This whole thing is so new to me. Bye.\\nYou got cheese and bread. You didn\\u2019t miss one ingredient. What you doing with that? Why you got the giant wrench? You told her about your mom, bro? You don\\u2019t tell nobody about your mom. Fuck, dog. You in love, man. About fucking time, man. My boy\\u2019s in love.\\nFuck that. I couldn\\u2019t get her out of here fast enough. This girl\\u2019s a disaster. She\\u2019s a nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIX MONTHS LATER\\nWant to get a mansion, a jacuzzi, a theater to watch my movies, a couple whips and lots of fancy things.\\nThe kids, they call the goonies.\\nI see the future crystal ball, mirror, mirror, hanging on the wall.\\nGot your girlfriend screaming all the cops.\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nClaudia.\\nHolly.\\nThere we go.\\nHey, what\\u2019s up, Glee?\\nBen, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.\\nAre we saying that now?\\nYeah, is that cool?\\nYeah, I mean, I don\\u2019t really like labels, but I like you a whole bunch. I like your friend a whole bunch. And if she wants to put a label on me, then she can sew it on wherever she wants. That was weird. That was weird. I\\u2019m not into S&M or anything like that, unless you are, which would be totally cool, you know? You do you.\\nWell, she really likes you, too. And that is very rare for her.\\nOh, look who\\u2019s talking.\\nHow\\u2019s the crowd in here tonight?\\nOver there, big boy.\\nOh, B.\\nDo ladies like dumplings? We just had the greatest dumplings.\\nPete, meet my sister. This is Pete, Claudia\\u2019s brother.\\n[Bea] Nice to meet you.\\nAnd Ben. Ben. This is Ben. We all grew up together.\\nHey.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nYou two know each other?\\nYeah, we met.\\n[Bea] Barely.\\nWow, that\\u2019s so random.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m going to go grab a drink.\\nDoor\\u2019s that way if you\\u2019re looking to sneak out. I know that\\u2019s your thing.\\n[Bea] Well, I am a disaster.\\nLet\\u2019s go away from this.\\nYeah.\\nSo you a lawyer yet?\\n[Bea] Why? Do you need a defense attorney?\\nI\\u2019m just curious how you passed the class on ethics and not bailing on people.\\nI think that\\u2019s the jerk who B got with when she was on her break from Jonathan.\\nNo way. So B\\u2019s the coffee girl who ghosted him?\\nI thought she looked familiar, but I don\\u2019t see faces. I just see souls.\\nAt least he made her realize that Jonathan was the one.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m engaged now.\\nGood for you. Where are you registered? I\\u2019ll buy you a broomstick.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019ll send you an invite. You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?\\nYou do remember. See, it did mean something to you.\\n[Bea] You\\u2019ll always be my rock bottom. The night I spent with a bitch.\\nDid she just call him a bitch?\\nYou think they\\u2019re going to physically fight?\\nOr fuck?\\nThat\\u2019s a fine line.\\n[Bea] Let\\u2019s just get through tonight for them, OK?\\nElle, she\\u2019s your sister. I\\u2019m sure the relationship won\\u2019t last long.\\n[Bea] She\\u2019s your friend. I question why they\\u2019re even together.\\nThen I\\u2019m going to get a drink and toast to never seeing you again.\\n[Bea] Cheers to that, bro.\\n\\nANYONE BUT YOU\\nSo before I pronounce this newlywed couple, if anyone has an issue with these two wonderful people joining together in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.\\nI have an objection.\\nLeo, don\\u2019t do this.\\nI have to, Annie. It\\u2019s just not right. There\\u2019s no way I can bless this union without their friends and family joining us to celebrate in Australia.\\nWe\\u2019re getting married in Sydney.\\n\\nWelcome on board. 2K to the front.\\nThank you, Sheryl.\\n51E, how long\\u2019s the flight?\\n16 hours. 51F, thanks. 73F, all the way to the back.\\nHey. Head of the wedding?\\n[Bea] Of my sister, yes, I am.\\nHow crazy is it that we\\u2019re on the same plane?\\n[Bea] Don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s thousands of flights flying to Sydney every day.\\nOh, there\\u2019s quite a few, actually. Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, some co-chairs. Serendipity, I guess.\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t think that word means what you think it means.\\nSo where\\u2019s your fiance? Wait, is this him? Hey, I\\u2019m Ben. I was her hall pass on your break.\\nWhat?\\nOh my god, I forgot. Claude told me you dumped him. Did you sneak out on your wedding day?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Bea] Wow, you are a child.\\nIt\\u2019s a pretty long flight. Do you want anything from the front of the boat? Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?\\n[Bea] No, thank you. I\\u2019m all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.\\nNothing small about me.\\nWhat the fuck?\\nHave a good flight. See you there.\\n\\nWhy do so many of us feel stuck? How is it even a very successful? Often feel like there is something missing from their lives. Why do so many people spend years mystically thinking about choices they might have made? One answer to that problem, many of us are leading lives that are misaligned with our own deepest values and preferences.\\nThank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain. What psychology can teach us about living our most authentic lives?\\n[Bea] What the fuck?\\n\\nHey, Vinny! Vindale! OK, Vin, looking good.\\nThanks for picking me up, dude.\\nNot just you, my guy.\\nSpelling Bee!\\n[Bea] Hey!\\nOur sisters are getting married. How dope is that?\\n[Bea] I know, I\\u2019m so excited.\\nOh, great. All right, let\\u2019s hit it.\\nThank you. I hope all of you have a wonderful vacation. I wish you all the best for the Mid-Autumn Festival.\\nBye.\\nY\\u2019all ready for Australia?\\nCan\\u2019t wait for y\\u2019all to see where we stay. And the plan is so dope.\\nWe\\u2019re all staying at the same place?\\nYep, my stepdad\\u2019s house. Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.\\n[Bea] Sounds like a piece of information that could have been shared a little earlier.\\nWell, that\\u2019s because they think you guys hate each other, so they didn\\u2019t want to poke the beard.\\n\\nNot bad, right?\\nYou don\\u2019t even play tennis.\\nI know, but I feel sweet.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee, y\\u2019all.\\nMeet Kalonabee.\\nHey, meet Kalonabee.\\nAll over.\\nAll over.\\nSpin, spin, spin.\\nWoo-hoo!\\nHe was the only member of the family who was trans.\\nYeah, he was there.\\n[Bea] Whoa.\\nYou\\u2019re right. This place is insane.\\nI know. All right, let\\u2019s get some sand under your feet.\\nHave you guys made up?\\nAll good.\\n[Bea] We\\u2019re fine if he just stays away from me.\\nDon\\u2019t need an invitation for that.\\n[Bea] I think you do if you\\u2019re like this. You can\\u2019t leave me alone.\\nSame reason I slowed down at the car crash.\\nOkay, so you guys buried the hatchet, water under the bridge, two adults adulting like fucking adults.\\nOh, we did have a little bit of a last minute snafu though. You guys are gonna have to share a room. There\\u2019s only one bed, but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.\\nShe\\u2019s kidding.\\n[Bea] You\\u2019re funny. I can\\u2019t wait any longer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWait for me!\\nHallie\\u2019s such a goof.\\nShe\\u2019s good for you. She could use some spontaneity.\\nHey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.\\nI hope so. I have a million contingencies and scenarios for everything. And honestly, I just want this wedding to be beautiful because I love the shit out of her and I just wanna marry the bitch, you know what I\\u2019m saying?\\nYou\\u2019re such a romantic.\\nHey, don\\u2019t be mad at me, but Margaret\\u2019s here.\\nWhy would I be mad? She lives here, I was 100% expecting to see her.\\nYeah. Margaret, Margaret, look who\\u2019s here.\\nThere she is. 100%.\\nGo rip off the band-aid.\\nBabe!\\nHow\\u2019s it going, stranger?\\nI was hoping you\\u2019d come. I wanted to message you, but I didn\\u2019t know how you\\u2019d feel about hearing from me.\\nAre you kidding?\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m never leaving.\\nNever leave.\\n[Bea] How are mom and dad?\\nThey\\u2019re good. You know, mom now thinks she\\u2019s Australian and dad\\u2019s not at all pointing out every tiny little detail that\\u2019s different. They\\u2019re also a little worried how you\\u2019re gonna react to all this.\\n[Bea] What are you talking about?\\nWell, you know, everybody thought that you\\u2019d be the one getting married first. You always used to talk about your wedding growing up. You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress when I just used it to dress like a mummy, you know?\\n[Bea] Hallie, stop. That\\u2019s not me anymore. I\\u2019m free now. I\\u2019m deprogrammed. That does not mean I don\\u2019t support you and your misguided view that soulmates exist.\\nThat\\u2019s sweet. Is that gonna be your toast?\\n[Bea] You and Claudia are the exception. I\\u2019m really happy for you, for real. What\\u2019s going on over there?\\nThat\\u2019s Claudia\\u2019s cousin. She visited the States a few years back. They dated. No biggie. Broke up with him. Crushed his heart.\\nNo way, that man does not have a heart.\\nFeels like forever ago. We were babies.\\nI\\u2019m really happy you\\u2019re here. We can reconnect as maybe not babies.\\nI would love that. Beau! Come eat my mate. Ben, this is my partner, Beau.\\nHi, mate.\\nLike, tennis partner?\\nSometimes after. How do you two dags know each other?\\nWe had a bit of a go back when, didn\\u2019t we?\\nDid you now? Good on ya. Hey, we\\u2019re gonna go trotting this weekend. Hit up the turps out here, eh? It\\u2019s gonna be a cracker. Woo!\\nYou know it.\\nGreat guy.\\nYeah.\\n\\nMommy!\\nHey, Beatrice.\\n[Bea] Dad!\\nYou made it.\\nOh, baby.\\nHi, baby.\\nHi, honey.\\nOh, my God.\\nWow.\\nHow\\u2019s our future lawyer?\\n[Bea] Great.\\nGreat.\\n[Bea] How\\u2019s the trip been?\\nOh, magical. The Australians are all wonderful. And excuse me, but good looking.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nWhy are they so weird about their plugs? I mean, this place is basically America. They speak English, they eat regular food, they have a complicated relationship with their past.\\nHow are you doing, honey?\\nI\\u2019m doing okay.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m doing great. My big sister\\u2019s getting married.\\nCould have been you. Could still be you someday.\\nHave you heard from Jonathan? Did he call or anything?\\nWell, that didn\\u2019t take long.\\nWe\\u2019re just torn up that he\\u2019s not part of our family anymore.\\nI mean, he works at our house every night from like 11 years old. He was basically family. Was about to be actual family.\\n[Bea] If I never ask you for anything ever again, can you please just lay off of me this weekend?\\nI just want both of our daughters to be happy.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m very happy, but not when you guys do this.\\nNed, you in the right direction? He\\u2019s such a great guy. Just think on it, yeah?\\n\\nBee, dinner at 7.30, okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Yeah.\\nBen, all set for dinner, yeah?\\nYeah, I\\u2019ll be there.\\n\\nI was plagiarizing.\\nHey!\\nHi Ben!\\nHey Ben!\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nEverybody?\\nDad\\u2019s speech.\\nOh yes, right, okay. We\\u2019re gonna make this short, because you\\u2019ve all traveled a bloody long distance, and Carol and I are so appreciative. Biggest thing we\\u2019ve missed since coming back from the States is not seeing our kids. And you lot, our extended family, so we\\u2019re just over the moon to have a full house before the wedding on Sunday.\\nWhere we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia, setting off on this crazy thing called life. And of course, Innie and Leo, our new family.\\nWell, we\\u2019re just so grateful, not only for your incredible hospitality, but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.\\nSo as they say in our country, abondanza.\\nCheers!\\nNow baby.\\nWow!\\nWhat classes are you loving? Have you given any more thought to tort law? \\u2018Cause class action is really where it\\u2019s at right now. What does Jonathan say? He knows you pretty well. What does he think you should do?\\n[Bea] Mom.\\nOkay.\\nI can\\u2019t even remember why we put you in the truck again. We didn\\u2019t put her in the trunk, she stowed away in the trunk.\\nYeah, I wanted to go with you guys to see Cinderella.\\nWe were going to Coachella.\\nI know that now, it was nice.\\nAll right, everyone. So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy. Let\\u2019s just have a moment to calm ourselves. I am not looking at anybody in particular, but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.\\nCrown chakra.\\nLet\\u2019s hit that cobra.\\nCleanse, get that weasel.\\nOkay.\\nGo!\\nYou go, you go.\\nSign of the times.\\nAll right, all right, four words.\\nFirst word, the, A, of, if.\\nAnimosity, hate, liar.\\nFive words.\\n[Bea] No, just shut the fuck up.\\nThe Bible.\\nA woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality to take advantage of other people.\\nMom, focus, okay? Right here, right here.\\nThis is a white people\\u2019s game. Y\\u2019all spend so much time trying to trick each other. Y\\u2019all got so much time on your hands. Just say the word.\\nIt\\u2019s on the extreme.\\nGrumpy old man.\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nOkay, okay, yeah, okay.\\n[Bea] Fuck boy.\\nOld cat woman.\\n[Bea] Your ego.\\nOkay.\\nWhat is this?\\n[Bea] Wait, no props.\\nNo one cares, no one can see us.\\n[Bea] Cheaters are shocking.\\nSays the woman who cheated on her fiance.\\n[Bea] We were on a break, asshole.\\nYou\\u2019re either broken up for good, or you\\u2019re cheating. Either way, someone\\u2019s lying to someone.\\n[Bea] I must have really gotten under your skin.\\nRoger, what is this?\\nFat, five.\\nWhat is the thing I\\u2019m holding in my hand?\\nFireworks.\\nFireworks by Katy Perry.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] That is not fair.\\nHey, what, you\\u2019re not fair. What\\u2019s wrong with you? Just stop.\\n[Bea] What are you doing?\\nWhat is wrong with you?\\n[Bea] Stop.\\nOh God.\\nOh God.\\nSam, what the?\\nOh my God.\\nAli.\\nGet back.\\nSam.\\nRoger.\\nI\\u2019ve got this.\\nThat\\u2019s some gangster shit right there.\\nSorry.\\n[Bea] Sorry.\\n\\nThey\\u2019re going to ruin our wedding.\\nAll that matters is that we\\u2019re together.\\nIt\\u2019s true.\\nLook baby, I love you to the moon and back, but those two fuckwads are going to destroy our weekend, and our memories, which we are going to have for a very long time, are headed straight over a cliff.\\nIt\\u2019s going to be fine baby, we just have to. to stand there and profess our love.\\nIt seems to me, their animus only surfaced after they spent a night together. Am I accurate?\\nThat\\u2019s usually how it goes, honey.\\nWe crumple our feelings into a ball and shove \\u2019em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.\\nThe solution appears to be simple then. We return them to the night they were spent.\\nLike we trick them into falling in love with each other?\\nHe didn\\u2019t say anything about love, honey. We just need to get them to jump each other\\u2019s bones.\\n\\nYeah, come on!\\nThat was good, right?\\nThat was good.\\nYou go, you go, you go, you go, you go.\\nShe clearly has eyes for Ben.\\nWho does, father?\\nHallie Spence, the sister. The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.\\nYou can\\u2019t say that. What the hell?\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that was rude. I apologize to anyone that was listening, which can only be you, Pete, \\u2019cause you\\u2019re the only person that was listening. I apologize.\\nI accept your apology and will now move on. Do you know Bea\\u2019s been in love with Ben since the first night they met?\\nWell, why didn\\u2019t she tell him? You know, when I was a young bloke and I liked a girl, I would sneak up behind her and I\\u2019d cut a lock of her hair and then I\\u2019d smack her on the bum!\\nWhat the hell?\\nI don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019m not good at this, sorry.\\nBea was just too scared to tell him, but I\\u2019ve talked to her and she says she regrets walking out that morning.\\nTell me more, son.\\nWhy me?\\nBecause you\\u2019re really good at it, right? You can do it.\\nWhy me, why? Why you put this hat on me? No one can see me, it\\u2019s a radio play, motherfucker. Bea wants us to tell him how much she likes him, so he lets his guard down and goes to her. Some Cupid\\u2019s killed with arrows and some with traps.\\nThat was good, I like that, that\\u2019s good.\\nI just made it up.\\nSo, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers, and say, \\u201cCome to Papa.\\u201d\\nWhat are you doing?\\nI\\u2019m from a different generation.\\nAnd your generation sucks. You fucked up the whole world for us.\\nAnd I\\u2019m full of shame. But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.\\nBut Ben feels awful that he called her a disaster. I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.\\nThen why is he fighting with her?\\nWell, because he likes her.\\nAnd I know that Bea likes Ben. She\\u2019s just denying herself because she\\u2019s got in her head somehow that she\\u2019ll never love again.\\nWhoa, I\\u2019m not talking about love, baby. I\\u2019m talking about dick.\\nOh, it\\u2019s Ben.\\nOh.\\nHey. You.\\n[Bea] Oh God, they got to you too?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia say how much I like you?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really?\\nIt was Pete and Roger.\\n[Bea] Fantastic, it\\u2019s a team effort. They\\u2019re trying to get us together.\\nNo way.\\n[Bea] Come here.\\nOh, maybe they want us to stop acting like assholes so we don\\u2019t ruin the biggest event of their lives.\\n[Bea] Us? There is no us and assholes. You\\u2019re the one who destroyed the living room.\\nWould you two mind helping me with something? I hate to ask, but I\\u2019d really appreciate it.\\nSure.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\n\\nSo Roger left his sunglasses on the sailboat. I swear, if his head wasn\\u2019t screwed on, we\\u2019d use it as a bowling ball. Do me a favor and swim out and get them. It\\u2019s the one on the right.\\nBoth of us.\\n[Bea] Is that really a two person job?\\nDoesn\\u2019t seem like it.\\nYou two. Yeah.\\n[Bea] All right, so everyone\\u2019s involved in this.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] I feel bad.\\nMe too.\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t want to bum Holly and Claudia out.\\nJust me and you.\\n[Bea] Can you not swim?\\nI\\u2019m an excellent swimmer.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of breath?\\nI\\u2019m fine. How much further do you think?\\n[Bea] Are your eyes closed?\\nI think it\\u2019s dark.\\n[Bea] Why are you so out of shape? You have like a 10 pop.\\nI\\u2019m not out of shape. I\\u2019ve been to 295, 300 once. I just don\\u2019t do cardio.\\n[Bea] Oh my God, you\\u2019re hot girl fit.\\nI\\u2019m not hot girl fit.\\n[Bea] Okay, my bad. We\\u2019ll see you at the boat.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nI could have done it myself, but whatever. Thanks.\\n[Bea] No fucking way.\\nHoney, look who\\u2019s here.\\n[Bea] I cannot believe they did this.\\nWho is that?\\n[Bea] That is my ex, Jonathan.\\nHey, hey.\\nWhat is he doing here?\\n[Bea] My Black Hawk helicopter parents have been trying to get us back together for the past four months.\\nThey flew him halfway across the world to your sister\\u2019s wedding? That\\u2019s some deep off shit. They came to play.\\n[Bea] That\\u2019s my parents. They think I\\u2019m throwing my life away.\\nHoney, we\\u2019re just gonna take him back and get him all settled in.\\nI\\u2019ll see you later.\\n[Bea] You know, maybe we should do it. Just tell everyone we\\u2019re together.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] It would solve that problem for me and that problem for you.\\nI don\\u2019t have a problem.\\n[Bea] You clearly want Margaret.\\nNo, I don\\u2019t.\\n[Bea] Yes, you do. I saw the way you looked at her last night and I know she broke your heart. She sees you\\u2019re with me. She wants what she can\\u2019t have and then bye bye crocodile Jack. Fuck, he\\u2019s fast.\\nMaking her jealous is not gonna work. We\\u2019re not in seventh grade.\\n[Bea] Trust me, bro. We\\u2019re all in seventh grade when it comes to this stuff. They\\u2019ve already gone through all of the bullshit trying to trick us into each other\\u2019s arms. Let\\u2019s just embrace it.\\nThere\\u2019s no way we can convince anyone we actually like each other.\\n[Bea] Yeah, you\\u2019re right.\\nI know.\\n[Bea] You know, I still think about that night we spent together.\\nShut up.\\n[Bea] No, I\\u2019m serious. You know, this could be kind of fun. We\\u2019re at a wedding a million miles away from home. Who knows what could happen under the cover of a masquerade. And that night at your place, no matter how it ended, it was still pretty amazing. \\u2026 Convincing enough?\\nFuck it. Let\\u2019s do it. \\u2026 Just wait. Wait.\\nOkay, okay. Whoever wants to go on the hike, we need to leave now. We\\u2019re running behind schedule.\\nWait, wait, wait.\\nBabe, the mountains have been there for millions of years. A few more minutes isn\\u2019t gonna hurt them.\\nBaby, I know you are trying to calm me down and I love you for it. Thank you. But I am hurting cats right now and I need some help instead of this easy breezy Martin Scorsese.\\nAw, jitters. Remember our wedding?\\nOnly that you\\u2019re the most beautiful bride on God\\u2019s green earth.\\nRight answer.\\nWe\\u2019re coming, we\\u2019re coming, we\\u2019re coming.\\nJinx, you owe me a cup.\\nOh, you have a little something in your teeth.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.\\nYeah, let me just take that out.\\nOh, I gotta get it out.\\nOh, it\\u2019s right there.\\nGet it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.\\nHoney, here he is.\\nHey.\\n[Bea] Jonathan.\\nSo nice to see you.\\n[Bea] I had no idea you were coming.\\nSo your parents didn\\u2019t tell you, okay? Yeah, you know, the first thing I asked them when they invited me was, \\u201cDoes B know?\\u201d \\u2018Cause otherwise this would be really fucking awkward. And now it is fucking awkward.\\nNo, no, not at all.\\nI\\u2019m in a lot of love.\\nNo, you\\u2019re like family. It\\u2019d be effing awkward if you weren\\u2019t here.\\nI\\u2019m so glad you\\u2019re here.\\nI\\u2019m so happy for you two. Hey, congratulations.\\nYeah, thanks.\\nRight?\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s great to see you.\\nIt\\u2019s great to see you too.\\nWe\\u2019re all going on a hike, so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out. Let\\u2019s move out.\\n[Bea] Ben, meet Jonathan.\\nOh, hey, man.\\nI\\u2019m Ben.\\nHey, oh, Pete and Claudia\\u2019s friend, right?\\nAlso friends with Bea, among other things.\\nYeah, it\\u2019s nice to meet you.\\nOkay, plenty of enough time in the car to do whatever the fuck this is. Come on, let\\u2019s go!\\nYeah, okay. Yeah.\\n[Bea] We need to come up with a game plan.\\nYeah, you are so terrible at this.\\n[Bea] What?\\nWe\\u2019re doing this thing!\\nHoney, I\\u2019m sorry. I know we should have asked you, but we had to invite you.\\nOh, it\\u2019s totally fine. I\\u2019m glad he\\u2019s here. I love him and Holly loves him.\\nReally?\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nGreat, okay. So we\\u2019re spending a little time together away from the real world and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.\\n[Bea] Oh, no, Mom, guys, no. I totally forgot to tell you, but I\\u2019m with Ben. \\u2026 Do you want to come?\\nI think I\\u2019m going to hang back and yell at your parents. Have fun.\\n\\nAlright, so is it like we just got together or we\\u2019ve been sneaking around? Oh, I got it. What if we ran into each other at Chipotle, lady in the tramp, the burrito?\\n[Bea] No.\\nThis can\\u2019t be that hard.\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s harder than you think. My parents don\\u2019t even believe it yet.\\nYou told them five seconds ago.\\n[Bea] They know I would never go out with a guy like you.\\nYou\\u2019ve been with one guy your entire life.\\n[Bea] Jonathan\\u2019s a better man than you\\u2019ll ever be.\\nAnd yet you left him. Which is why exactly? Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.\\n[Bea] Okay, you don\\u2019t know my boxes and you never will. Just figure this out, please.\\nOkay. We just suck face in front of everybody. Half of them think they set us up anyway.\\n[Bea] No, that\\u2019s too much. We need to do something that\\u2019s more hidden so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.\\nYou\\u2019re calling me a fuckboy like it\\u2019s an insult? I own that shit.\\n[Bea] Let\\u2019s just be affectionate. I know it\\u2019s a foreign concept for you.\\nI can be affectionate. I\\u2019ll affectionate the shit out of you.\\nI can\\u2019t believe your parents invited Jonathan. Now I have to find a table to sit him at.\\nWhat about Bea?\\nNo, no, she\\u2019s fine. She\\u2019s sitting with us at our table.\\nNo, I\\u2019m talking about how she\\u2019s already at a low point because she\\u2019s going through a breakup and I don\\u2019t even know what\\u2019s happening with school. She never even talks about it anymore.\\nI guess I could put up with the cousins.\\nWhy?\\nYou alright?\\nOh, shit.\\nWow.\\nCheck it out, guys!\\nNice!\\nYeah!\\nBeautiful!\\nSee, I told you it was going to be good.\\nMan, that\\u2019s nice.\\n[Bea] Oh, wow.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] So beautiful.\\nThere it is.\\nFeel the serenity.\\nPretty spectacular, hey?\\nIt\\u2019s amazing.\\n[Bea] Alright, your turn.\\nWow.\\n[Bea] This is just so romantic.\\nOkay, nuzzle my neck.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nGet in there. Damn, you are short.\\n[Bea] You are not tall enough to say that.\\nOh.\\n[Bea] Oh, are you ticklish?\\nNo, I\\u2019m acting.\\n[Bea] Like a toddler?\\nNo, go away. Okay, I can use that.\\n[Bea] Beg me. Beg me to stuff you in the butt.\\nStop! Just let me do it. Permission to put my left hand on your right buttock.\\n[Bea] Granted. Too hard.\\nSorry. You gotta sell it.\\n[Bea] Okay, not in circles. It\\u2019s not a magic lamp.\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] Okay, now you\\u2019re just playing bop it.\\nI\\u2019ve never rubbed a bopper show.\\n[Bea] Clearly, you\\u2019ve tried. Are you not wearing underwear?\\nIt\\u2019s a swimsuit. I\\u2019m on holiday.\\n[Bea] Oh.\\nOkay, just mind the gap.\\n[Bea] How\\u2019s that?\\nThat\\u2019s good. Just like, but you don\\u2019t have to hover. Just kind of, oh, man the woods.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m sorry.\\nOkay, just take it out.\\n[Bea] You try.\\nYou want me to stick my finger in my own ass? How\\u2019s that gonna convince? Oh, on you. I can\\u2019t. Jesus Christ, it\\u2019s like a vacuum pack down here. How\\u2019d you get in this thing? Oh, man, it\\u2019s tight. Oh, see, it\\u2019s like holding a baby bird.\\n[Bea] God damn it.\\nWere they not watching this whole time?\\n[Bea] You like a mole or something on your butt?\\nNo.\\n[Bea] Really? \\u2018Cause I feel something.\\nI don\\u2019t have a mole. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Are there any more on me?\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t know.\\nJack, spiders hunt bears. They hunt bears.\\nNo pictures. Put the cameras down. We\\u2019re not gonna take a spirit.\\nAre there any more?\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t know.\\nWhere are they? I feel it. I feel it.\\n[Bea] I think I see something.\\nWhat do you see? What do you see?\\n[Bea] Oh, no, that\\u2019s just a part of you. You\\u2019re fine.\\nAll right, look, if I have one of those little fuckers in me, they might be in you.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m good.\\nThat\\u2019s probably a better way to check than what I did.\\n[Bea] Yeah.\\nAll right, little one, we join your journey. We do not inherit the earth. We just borrow it from our creatures.\\nHey, guys. What did we miss?\\nWow.\\n\\nWhy can\\u2019t I get this?\\nBecause you\\u2019re meant to learn to dive when you\\u2019re six.\\nYou got this, hon.\\nYou ever try focusing on your toes? My mom taught me this trick. If you pretend like there\\u2019s a string from your nose to your toes, you just kind of maintain that position. You mind doing it again? This time I\\u2019m going to shout out a tribute question. I think it\\u2019s just going to help clear your mind.\\nJust make sure it\\u2019s a question about airplanes or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\\nOkay, um, uh, what company created the Concorde?\\nA collaboration between British Airways and the French government. How\\u2019d I do?\\nYou\\u2019re good there.\\nMaybe your mom can teach him how to dive.\\nShe passed away.\\nOh, I\\u2019m so sorry.\\nYeah, sorry.\\nAll right, I\\u2019m going to go again, but this time give me one with a little shorter answer.\\nI have a better idea. You just let me do everything, I\\u2019ll guide you in. Don\\u2019t think.\\nBe careful of his shoulder.\\nYeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.\\nWouldn\\u2019t let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.\\nI had to tell her I love her. When you know she\\u2019s the one, nothing else matters.\\nI\\u2019m waving, thank you, thank you.\\nThere you go.\\nDid I do it?\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Good job, babe.\\nYour dad\\u2019s a natural.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m so glad you guys got to spend some time with Ben.\\nAre you two really\\u2026\\n\\u2026getting to know each other in a very respectful manner? One befitting such a kind and intelligent woman as your daughter.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are in the early stages.\\nNot too early.\\n[Bea] But also not so advanced.\\nJust that magical moment when two people come together in this crazy journey we call life.\\n[Bea] That\\u2019s why I was so worried when Jonathan showed up. I don\\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.\\nI even suggested we hide our light under a bushel for his sake.\\n[Bea] But our love is just so strong. And I know what you guys are thinking. He\\u2019s much older.\\nThey weren\\u2019t, right? Probably thinking I\\u2019m 27, early 28s.\\n[Bea] Yes, we are very happy.\\nHappiest.\\n[Bea] Yep.\\nYou know, you looked like that back in the day.\\nNo, I didn\\u2019t. That guy\\u2019s made out of cobblestone.\\nThey\\u2019re holding hands.\\nI think it\\u2019s working.\\nI can\\u2019t believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.\\n[Bea] Was that bullshit about your mom?\\nWhat?\\n[Bea] The story about the giant wrench. I thought it might have been a lie until all your one night nothings.\\nYou ever heard that too?\\n[Bea] Like, I didn\\u2019t mean\\u2026 I\\u2019m sorry. And it wasn\\u2019t a lie.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so nice to my dad. You should probably rinse off. You have his SPF a billion on you now.\\nCheers, mate. I\\u2019ll just grab a quickie.\\nOkay.\\nSo, Australia. What do you reckon, eh? How you finding it?\\nI don\\u2019t know. It\\u2019s great.\\nMaz goes on about you all the time. Ripper Cunt, she calls you.\\nMaz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is\\u2026\\nGood friend. Oh, yeah. You know you had a proper surf when sand gets all up your clacker. And your gobbler, too.\\nGobbler is\\u2026\\nYou know, your hog bonnet. You know, your beef cap. Come on, mate. You know, the anteater. Anyway, good to have ya. Gotcha.\\nG\\u2019day, love.\\nHey, mate. Fancy a game?\\n[Bea] You\\u2019re going down. How have you been doing?\\nPretty good. You?\\n[Bea] Okay, I guess.\\nHow\\u2019s school going? Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?\\n[Bea] You know me. I\\u2019ve never been one for practicing.\\nStill having second thoughts?\\n[Bea] Straight to third.\\nI know it\\u2019s weird, me being here, but believe me, I had nothing to do with it. Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.\\n[Bea] That\\u2019s sweet. You\\u2019re part of the family.\\nI\\u2019d be lying if I said I haven\\u2019t been thinking about you.\\n[Bea] Yeah, me too.\\nHow long have you and that guy, Ben, been?\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s kind of new. Not like new, new, but newish.\\nWell, I think he seems great.\\n[Bea] No, you don\\u2019t.\\nI really don\\u2019t.\\n[Bea] Thanks for being so cool about all of this. Not just this, but this too.\\nIt\\u2019s really good to see you, Bea.\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m glad you\\u2019re here. Now let\\u2019s have fun.\\nLet\\u2019s do it.\\nMate.\\nThat\\u2019s me.\\nYou want a coffee? It\\u2019s the best in the world.\\nYou guys are really proud of your coffee here.\\nIt\\u2019s the best in the fucking world.\\nOkay.\\nEnjoy.\\nFuck, that is good.\\nI was thinking of going for a bit of a run later. Do you want to join?\\nI\\u2019m actually going on a bike ride with Bea, so I don\\u2019t think I can.\\nShe\\u2019s a little sweet on you, hey?\\nOh, you caught that.\\nHow long have you and Beau been together?\\nNah, we\\u2019re just banging about. He\\u2019s nice, but I think I\\u2019m looking for someone less casual. More romantic.\\nWow.\\nWhy did me and you ever break up anyway?\\nI don\\u2019t really remember, but I think you said something like I was an immature, drongo, smothered in ex body spray.\\nSmells like you\\u2019re not that guy anymore. Bea\\u2019s a lucky girl.\\nOh.\\nHey, open the door. Bea.\\n[Bea] What\\u2019s wrong?\\nMargaret thinks we\\u2019re together.\\n[Bea] That\\u2019s great.\\nNo, Margaret needs to think we\\u2019re the right type of together. Not together together, but like situationally together. \\u2018Cause if she thinks we\\u2019re together together, she\\u2019s not gonna break girl code. So we need to finesse our togetherness so that we\\u2019re together, but there\\u2019s an opening for our togetherness and she can just slide right in so that we can be together.\\n[Bea] Are you on Coke?\\nNo, it\\u2019s like coffee here. It\\u2019s like meth. I\\u2019m guessing. No, I\\u2019m not. I worked at Goldman. Partner\\u2019s wedding. Do what you do.\\n[Bea] Jesus, dude, who are you?\\nI\\u2019m a man trying to figure this out. Look at your room, it\\u2019s so much bigger. You got a painting? Wow, that\\u2019s so red. We have to kick it up a notch. Make it feel like we\\u2019re in the Gaga stage.\\n[Bea] What do you wanna do, take me in the hallway?\\nThat is not Gaga. Actually, that could be construed as Gaga. Tonight\\u2019s the rehearsal dinner, so we have to do something that makes it look like you\\u2019re into me, but you\\u2019re not into me. And I\\u2019m into you, but you can tell by my face that it\\u2019s never gonna mount.\\n[Bea] Get it together, man.\\nYou hit me so much.\\n\\nOkay, Kalana, now pretend this is a real fox that messed up our garden. Fuck it up. Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up. Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up. Fuck it up. Ooh. You see that?\\nHe did it, yeah. Oh, hey, they\\u2019re here. All right, everybody, wheels up.\\nHustle up.\\nBad dog.\\nYou look cute.\\nBaby, you look so good.\\nShe\\u2019s has been.\\nYou look so good.\\nYeah, I look bad.\\nMan, this is the best time to say that.\\nDaddy\\u2019s a dad.\\nCome on, let\\u2019s go.\\nYeah.\\nAll right, let\\u2019s do it.\\nThank you.\\nYou see the size of that boat?\\nHey, guys.\\nWoo!\\n[Bea] Nice touch.\\nNice dress.\\nYou have a good heart.\\nI love this dress.\\nYou look fine.\\nOh, thank you.\\nWhat would you like to drink?\\nWhat\\u2019s a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?\\nThree scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.\\nOh, thank you.\\nAll right.\\nYou remembered.\\nThat you can\\u2019t handle hard liquor? Yeah, the smell\\u2019s still not out of my car.\\nYou know I feel really bad about that. That was a fun night. That was a fun summer.\\nMarks! Marks, captain says that we can steer the ship.\\nOh, okay, I\\u2019m coming. Hang on, I\\u2019ve got heels on.\\nLook how lucky we are. On a boat sailing back and forth with no real transportation or reason.\\nOkay.\\nAnd look at you, Polly Pocket. You the belle of the boat.\\nHe didn\\u2019t remember me.\\nOh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?\\nNo, honey, that\\u2019s, yes, I think it might be. Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.\\nThere it is.\\nWell, at least that was subtle.\\n[Bea] Was it?\\nThis oddly reminds me of prom.\\n[Bea] The first or second time?\\nJonathan is just the most perfect guy.\\nHe\\u2019s like a son to us.\\nWell, that might be a problem, mate. They might not wanna shag a brother.\\nSo how\\u2019s it going? Can parents back off a little?\\n[Bea] How about you?\\nGame on.\\n[Bea] Can you even dance?\\nYou just let me lead.\\n[Bea] Oh, God.\\nLet\\u2019s go.\\nIs Margaret watching?\\nIt\\u2019s a little hard to tell what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.\\nEverybody to the top deck, we about to do a champagne toast.\\n[Bea] Come with me.\\nSo what are we doing?\\n[Bea] Closing the deal. Titanic me.\\nWhat?\\nOh, help yourself to some champagne.\\nOh, thank you.\\nGrab some drinks.\\nOh, great.\\nNice.\\n[Bea] Titanic me.\\nNo, that is so lame.\\n[Bea] Exactly. The only people who would do something this lame are the ones who know how lame it is, but are in the first stages of liking each other, so they\\u2019re totally comfortable in their mutual lameness. Toast me.\\nOh my God.\\n[Bea] Come on.\\nThis is so cringe. So is saying cringe, old man.\\n[Bea] Lift my arms.\\nI\\u2019ve seen the movie.\\n[Bea] Have you?\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] Okay.\\nThis is never gonna work.\\nAww! That is the cutest thing I\\u2019ve ever seen!\\nAre they doing Titanic?\\nAww!\\n[Bea] Are they watching?\\nYep.\\n[Bea] Are they buying it?\\nCan\\u2019t imagine they would.\\nIt\\u2019s real. We did it.\\nWe\\u2019re good. We\\u2019re really bloody good.\\nJonathan, have you seen Tasmania?\\nInya, I\\u2019m fine. It\\u2019s fine.\\nCan I do the line? That\\u2019s king of the world. You\\u2019re king of the world.\\n[Bea] Jack, I\\u2019m flying!\\nOkay, we can stop there.\\nWe can stop there.\\nThey\\u2019re gone. Show\\u2019s over.\\nOh my god!\\n[Bea] No! Wait for me! Help! Wait! Wait!\\nBae! Bea! Are you okay?\\n[Bea] Yeah. Why\\u2019d you jump in?\\nTo save you!\\n[Bea] But you\\u2019re a terrible swimmer!\\nI\\u2019m a great swimmer! Just short distances.\\n[Bea] We\\u2019re gonna die.\\nWe\\u2019re not gonna die.\\n[Bea] We\\u2019re gonna get hypothermia.\\nThe water\\u2019s 90 degrees.\\n[Bea] We\\u2019re gonna get eaten by sharks. Fuck! We\\u2019re gonna get eaten by sharks!\\nWe are gonna be fine. And we spent ten hours shredding water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.\\n[Bea] Goldman?\\nYeah, it was a partner\\u2019s kids bar mitzvah. A little bit of crack.\\nOh my god!\\nRoger!\\nOh my god!\\nIt looks like they\\u2019re going full Titanic. I love the commitment!\\nStop the boat!\\nNo, no, no.\\nHelp!\\nThey\\u2019re coming!\\nStay calm!\\nThis is not a very good swim.\\nBei!\\nThere.\\n[Bea] Are you sure?\\nYeah. Come on.\\nWhy aren\\u2019t we turning the boat around?\\nWe are in too shallow of water. We\\u2019ll run aground.\\nBut harbour rescue has been notified.\\nCome on.\\nAre you good?\\n[Bea] Mm-hmm.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] All right. Okay.\\nLet\\u2019s go.\\n[Bea] All right, get in the row.\\nOkay.\\n[Bea] That was, um, probably the most\\u2013 I mean, if you didn\\u2019t close it with Margaret, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 There\\u2019s nothing more romantic than jumping in to save me.\\nYeah, well, Jonathan didn\\u2019t do it, that\\u2019s for sure. Your parents half the clock, that\\u2019s shit.\\n[Bea] You didn\\u2019t even give him a chance.\\nWhy do you keep defending this guy? Why do you break up with him in the first place?\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s complicated.\\nIt\\u2019s never complicated. What, he cheated on you? Drug problem? Did you catch him measuring his dick with a ruler app?\\n[Bea] We never fought.\\nIsn\\u2019t that a good thing?\\n[Bea] It was just comfortable. And he\\u2019s a great guy, which means there\\u2019s no one out there for me because I had the best one. I couldn\\u2019t even tell him I quit law school. And I have no idea what I\\u2019m gonna do with my life. We\\u2019re gonna get eaten by sharks, I had to tell somebody.\\nNo one else knows?\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.\\nYou finally did it.\\n[Bea] What?\\nYou know, one night you said you didn\\u2019t want to be a lawyer anyways.\\n[Bea] You remember that?\\nIt was a memorable night, until you snuck out, of course. Why did you?\\n[Bea] Because you scared the shit out of me. It was the first time in my life that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.\\nI know a little bit about that. I was really hurt when you left. So I said all that terrible stuff about you to Pete. That\\u2019s not how I felt.\\n[Bea] Look at us. Just a couple of fucked up people floating in the middle of the harbor. Promise me if we make it out alive we\\u2019ll go see that from dry land.\\nIt\\u2019s a pretty killer view from here.\\n[Bea] It\\u2019s dumb but I want to see the people. Landmarks like those are full of people in love. Marriage proposals, honeymooners, romantics jumping off of moving trains just to see the building with the person they love.\\nLike your dad in the Eiffel Tower?\\n[Bea] He told you that?\\nNothing else matters when it comes to love.\\n[Bea] You could use a bit of that right now.\\nIt\\u2019s not dumb. You, me and the opera house. It\\u2019s a date. I promise.\\n[Bea] What\\u2019s wrong?\\nI\\u2019m a little afraid of flying.\\n[Bea] Don\\u2019t you fly all the time for your job?\\nI have a very specific routine. I mask, headphones, build my bubble.\\nThat\\u2019s my Serenity song. How do you know my Serenity song?\\n[Bea] Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\n[Bea] You all good?\\nShut the fuck up now!\\nThanks again.\\nStay out of the water, yeah?\\nWant some coffee?\\n[Bea] Not the stuff from here. I\\u2019ll be up all night.\\nYeah.\\n[Bea] Thanks for kind of saving me though.\\nIt was fun.\\n[Bea] Stupid, but fun.\\nWell, that\\u2019s the best kind.\\n\\nNo, no, no, it\\u2019s hot!\\n[Bea] I\\u2019m warm.\\nWhen are you ever gonna learn? Like, you want me to blow on it? \\u2026 Is it still hot?\\nWe\\u2019re getting pretty good at faking it.\\n[Bea] I don\\u2019t even know what\\u2019s real anymore. Everything I do just feels like a mistake.\\nBen, Steve, are you guys all right?\\nBen, wait, you hear?\\nI can\\u2019t hear you.\\nSteve!\\nBeatrice! Beatrice!\\n\\nHoney, what are these? Is that a handprint?\\nNo.\\nCome on, baby gorgeous. We got chores. Come on, let\\u2019s go. Ben, are you ready? We got groom stuff to do.\\nDude, I\\u2019m coming, I\\u2019m coming.\\nMan, I hope you scrub from top to bottom, \\u2019cause who knows what was in that heart rate.\\nI also showered last night.\\nTwo showers in eight hours? Go off, King, get clean!\\n[Bea] Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?\\nYes, I\\u2019m so excited to marry Claudia. But, you know, I\\u2019m also hosting a party where it feels like we\\u2019re all playing parts in a play, and I\\u2019m not really into the pageantry, and I kinda just wanna do a little\\u2013\\n[Bea] All that matters is that you and Claudia run for the rest of your lives together.\\nI love you.\\n[Bea] I love you too.\\nBae? Hey, you\\u2019re still good to get the cake, right?\\n[Bea] Yes, ma\\u2019am.\\nAwesome. I put Margaret on it with you, just to be safe.\\n[Bea] Margaret.\\n\\nAll right, talk to me, baby.

Maybe early drinks?\\n[Bea] Guys, I am so sorry, but your plan is all ruined. We are not together. We were faking it the whole time.\\nYou knew?\\nWhat are they even talking about?\\nWell, we may have orchestrated a union between the pair of them in order for peace to prevail across the land.\\nYou lied to us? What have you been honest about lately?\\nSo you lied to me too?

January 26, 2024, marked the debut of Badland Hunters on the American platform. This film is actor Heo Myeong-haeng\\u2019s directorial debut, known for his roles in Old Boy and Arahan, and recently for directing The Roundup: Punishment, the fourth explosive installment of the series, set to premiere at the 74th Berlinale\\u2019s special events.\\nWritten by Kim Bo-tong and Kwak Jae-min, the story takes us to a post-apocalyptic Seoul, devastated by a catastrophic earthquake, turning the city into a wild, desolate wasteland inhabited by desperate souls and ruthless armed gangs. In this chaotic world where water is more precious than gold, a brave hunter named Nam-san (played by international star Don Lee, known for Train to Busan and as Gilgamesh in Eternals) steps up when a dear teenager is kidnapped by a deranged scientist conducting human experiments to create an immortal race, within a \\u201ccondo,\\u201d the only building left standing after the disaster. The plot of Badland Hunters is pretty bare-bones, offering just what\\u2019s needed for a dystopian fantasy-action film aimed at no-frills entertainment, reminiscent of the platform\\u2019s similar venture, Black Knight, a somewhat lackluster series adaptation by Cho Ui-seok from the webtoon Delivery Knight by Lee Yun-gyun.\\n* * *\\n[whirring, beeping]\\n[somber music playing]\\n[squelching]\\n[man gasping]\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[moans]\\n[object clatters]\\nSo-yeon.\\n[gasps]\\n[device beeping]\\n[tense music playing]\\nRight.\\nSo-yeon.\\nSo-yeon.\\nI\\u2019m gonna try again.\\nI swear you\\u2019re gonna live, okay?\\n[banging at door]\\n[banging continues]\\n[banging continues]\\n[woman] Gi-su!\\n[man gasps]\\n\\n\\n\\nYang Gi-su!\\nStop right now.\\nJust let So-yeon go.\\nI have to revive her.\\nShe\\u2019ll be dead if we don\\u2019t act now.\\nDon\\u2019t make me shoot.\\nGi-su, wait.\\nYou\\u2019ve taken over a hundred lives with these horrific experiments.\\nThis isn\\u2019t what So-yeon would have wanted.\\nYour daughter\\u2019s not going to come back.

Today, we\\u2019ll learn why we need to change our metabolism.\\nOpen your books, everyone.\\nLet\\u2019s first talk about the anatomy of humans as things stand.\\nBecause we currently need to drink water and consume food in order to survive, we\\u2019ve wasted precious resources on people that do not serve the greater cause.\\nTo be frank, we are weak, and in our current world, which is plagued by a shortage of water, mankind needs to take a new, stronger physical form.\\nWe must develop a new metabolic system in order to breed humans that can survive for extended periods of dehydration and malnutrition, thereby reversing the population decline and paving the way for civilization to be reborn.\\nChildren, in this harsh and unforgiving world, always remind yourselves of Dr. Yang Gi-su\\u2019s miracle and of your own responsibilities.\\nOur metabolism will improve through Dr. Yang\\u2019s research, and eventually, mankind will finally be given a body which can adapt to this brave new world.\\nPay attention, Su-na.\\nIt\\u2019s just odd.\\nNobody even has enough to drink on the outside, yet the people here are able to drink however much they want and even shower.\\nEveryone keeps going on and on about Dr. Yang Gi-su.\\nShouldn\\u2019t he be giving water to everybody out there who needs it?\\n[unsettling music playing]\\nOh, Su-na.\\nThe outside world is full of barbarians.\\nThe exact same type that killed Yang Gi-su\\u2019s beloved daughter.\\nIn order to join the new humanity,\\nyou need to be the right kind of person.\\nWhat kind\\u2026 what kind of person is that?\\n[Ju-ye] People that offer aid in furthering the doctor\\u2019s research.\\nI wanna be a part of the research support.\\nWell, you sound like you have the right attitude, Ju-ye, no?\\nSu-na sure could learn a lot from you.\\n[Ju-ye] Yes, ma\\u2019am.\\n[Teacher] Now, then, for our next lesson, we\\u2019ll be learning about organisms that are best at surviving in the wild.\\nWe\\u2019ll be getting a visit from Dr. Yang Gi-su later, so let\\u2019s all welcome him properly to show our gratitude.\\n[all] Yes.\\n[exhales]\\n[Teacher] These rations are the fruits of your parents\\u2019 hard work, as I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all aware.\\nLet us all dig in with a thankful heart.\\nAnd there\\u2019s the water, which is more valuable than anything else in this world.\\nMake sure to drink it all down to the very last drop.\\nDr. Yang Gi-su had it specially purified for all of you here.\\nJu-ye.\\n[Gi-su] Hello, everyone.\\n[Teacher] Alright, a round of applause, everyone.\\nAttention.\\nBow.\\n\\u201cStudents are our hope.\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re all aware of our apartment\\u2019s motto, right?\\nThat\\u2019s the reason we\\u2019ve been supplying our students with a special diet.\\n[inhales] The world is beset by a shortage of food and water, as you know.\\nI\\u2019m working day and night to create a new world where humans are going to be able to survive and live a good life with only a minuscule amount of food and drinking water.\\nBut until that day comes, you all need to finish everything you\\u2019re given, making sure not to waste any.\\nYes.\\nAlright.\\nDoctor, we have someone very promising.\\nOh, there.\\nMm-hmm. She\\u2019s wonderful.\\nHer name?\\n[Teacher] Lee Ju-ye.\\n[Gi-su] Lee Ju-ye, right?\\nYes.\\nHi. You\\u2019re 18?\\nYeah!\\nI heard you really wanted to help me with my research.\\n[Ju-ye] Mm.\\nWhy don\\u2019t we get the ball rolling with a consultation?\\n[Teacher] Yes, of course.\\nUh-huh.\\nWell, uh, why don\\u2019t we have you eat first?\\nUh, I\\u2019ll send someone over to meet you in three hours, huh? And then we can get started.\\nOh wow! Thank you, Doctor. [giggles]\\n[Gi-su] Right.\\nLet\\u2019s go.\\nDr. Yang.\\nWhere\\u2019s my grandmother? Did she get here safe?\\nOf course she did. Don\\u2019t you worry.\\nIf my grandmother\\u2019s here, I wanna see her.\\n[Gi-su exhales in annoyance]\\nExcuse me.\\nDid you explain everything to her?\\n[gasps]\\nI\\u2019m so sorry.\\n[unsettling music playing]\\nSu-na.\\nUh, your grandmother is much worse than we expected, so we\\u2019ll have to keep her in treatment for the next two to three days.\\nGrandma got that sick on the way here?\\n[chuckles nervously]\\nShe just needs to rest, okay?\\nYou\\u2019re going to be able to see her in a day or so.\\nDr. Yang Gi-su himself is personally seeing to her treatment\\u2026\\nYes, of course. Now,\\nI have been overseeing her care, so don\\u2019t worry, okay?\\nShe\\u2019s going to be much better soon, and\\u2026\\nOh, Su-na.\\nSu-na, you\\u2019re terribly malnourished right now. Huh?\\nSo drink some water.\\nYou\\u2019ll regain your health. Here.\\nHmm?\\nAlright, then. Enjoy your dinners, and don\\u2019t forget,\\nyou are our future!\\n[unsettling music building]\\n[music fades]\\n[groaning weakly]\\n[exhales forcefully]\\nAlright, clean things up here.\\n[woman] Yes, sir.\\nIt\\u2019s been over 20 hours, and Sergeant Choi and Sergeant Oh haven\\u2019t returned.\\nThings could get bad for them if they don\\u2019t make it in time.\\n[Gi-su] They should be okay.\\nMaybe we should hand out personal doses in case of situations like this.\\n[sighs]\\nIt\\u2019s still too dangerous for people to carry.\\nBesides, there\\u2019s no telling what kind of side effects we\\u2019ll see going forward.\\nHow long are we going to have to keep injecting?\\nWe\\u2019re starting to run out of children to bring to the apartment.\\nWe\\u2019re gonna get there.\\nJust be patient.\\n[Kwon exhales]\\nGet back to work.\\nThey only care about themselves.\\nDignity for humans?\\nLong gone.\\n[breathes deeply]\\nThis research needs to come to fruition, right?\\nIf we want a meaningful life\\u2026 it\\u2019ll only be when\\u2026 when they realize the sacrifices of these evolutionary rejects was necessary for survival.\\nThat day will come, don\\u2019t you think?\\n[grunts]\\n[sighs]\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[lock clicks]\\n[music fades]\\nTime for a shift change.\\n[indistinct chatter]\\nExcuse me. Excuse me.\\n[chuckles]\\nUh, we, uh, signed up to see our child earlier on.\\nWhen will we be able to go see her?\\nA meeting? What do you mean, meeting?\\nThe teacher said that after we finish our work for the day,\\nwe could sign up to visit our daughter.\\nUh, there\\u2019s, um\\u2026\\nWe don\\u2019t have that policy.\\nShe definitely told us that earlier on.\\nWe\\u2019re happy to go to the eighth floor if Ju-ye can\\u2019t come down.\\nThe eighth floor is especially off-limits to regular residents.\\nUh, well, where\\u2019s the teacher, then?\\n[sighs] You know what? Where\\u2019s our daughter?\\nWhat the hell do you mean we can\\u2019t go see our child?\\nThis is ridiculous!\\n[man] They\\u2019re stopping them seeing their child.\\n[woman] I hope our kids are okay.\\nDon\\u2019t mind us and change shifts, everyone.\\nWe\\u2019ll talk about this tomorrow.\\nWait, wait, wait. Where\\u2019s Ju-ye?\\nNo, look here.\\nHuh? Where the hell is our daughter, you bastards?!\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[breathing heavily]\\n[door opens]\\n[gasps]\\nListen, how many times do I have to tell you not to interrupt me when I\\u2019m experimenting?\\nI\\u2019m sorry, sir.

of humans as things standbecause we currently need to drink water and consume food in order to survive weve wasted precious resources on people that do not serve the greater causeto be frank we are weak and in our current world which is plagued by a shortage of water mankind needs to take a new stronger physical formwe must develop a new metabolic system in order to breed humans that can survive for extended periods of dehydration and malnutrition thereby reversing the population decline and paving the way for civilization to be rebornchildren in this harsh and unforgiving world always remind yourselves of dr yang gisus miracle and of your own responsibilitiesour metabolism will improve through dr yangs research and eventually mankind will finally be given a body which can adapt to this brave new worldpay attention sunaits just oddnobody even has enough to drink on the outside yet the people here are able to drink however much they want and even showereveryone keeps going on and on about dr yang gisushouldnt he be giving water to everybody out there who needs itoh sunathe outside world is full of barbariansthe exact same type that killed yang gisus beloved daughterin order to

that we and other nations who believe in freedom and who believe in human rights let our voices be heard in an absolutely clear way and not add the imprimatur of approval to the soviet union and its government while they have heavily armed invading forces in the freedomloving and innocent and deeply religious country of afghanistanand i hope recognition of a grateful nation will at least
